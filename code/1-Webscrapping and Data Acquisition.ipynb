    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "Reddit is a social news, content, and discussions website. Posts are organised according to subject into user-created 'subreddits', which covers practically any topic imaginable. Members submit content (such as images, texts, and links) to subreddits. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a new investment company which has 2 main trading desks - one for traditional securities and another for cryptocurrency, reddit is a platform that piques our interest. The authentic daily discussions from the wide range of financial discussions, from financial news, to market data, and traditional securities in the Investing subreddit, to the blockchain technology and general sentiments for new coins in the CryptoCurrency subreddit, this raw conversations are what we intend to keep our eyes peeled on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to automate the monitoring of reddit posts related to investing for new investing leads for both desks. Through this new leads and hot trends, I hope to filter this information to the specific trading desks. As such, I need a model to analyse and categorise the reddit posts for further review & investigation by either the securities or crypto trading desks. The prediction will be made with the best logistic regression model or Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier, with Count Vectoriser or TF-IDF Vectoriser, as evaluated by F1 score, Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "4 models were evaluated, namely Logistic Regression (Count Vectoriser), Logistic Regression (TF-IDF Vectoriser), Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier (Count Vectoriser) and Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier(TF-IDF Vectoriser). The entire dataset was split into a training dataset and a testing dataset. Logistic Regression (TF-IDF Vectoriser) is preferred as compared to the other 3 models. Two reasons for this: maximization of focus metric, and best overall balance in our 4 metrics. Our focus metric, specificity, performed best in a logistic regression. The highest specificity is desired in the models. In addition, the logistic regression scores over 90% on 3 out of 4 metrics, while specificity scores a hair below 90%, at 89.9%.\n",

    "## Data Collection and Filtering\n",
    "### PushShift API\n",
    "The pushshift.io Reddit API was designed and created by the /r/datasets mod team to help provide enhanced functionality and search capabilities for searching Reddit comments and submissions. I need to create a loop for the PushShift API as it only allows 100 post per request. The two subreddits I have chosen are: r/investing and r/CryptoCurrency. I have 2 goals to achieve while collecting this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "1. Collect at least 1000 non-duplicate submissions from each subreddit, these submissions should not have 'removed', 'deleted' or empty titles either.\n",
    "2. Collect 'title', 'subreddit','author','selftext' and 'created_utc'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function's Logic\n",
    "The idea behind the pushshift function are as follows: \n",
    "1. To collect data before the stipulated time daily.\n",
    "2. With each loop, the 100 post requested will be filtered to be free from entries having 'removed', 'deleted' or empty entries to reduce guesswork needed down the line.\n",
    "3. Create a loop counter to check the progress of the data collection and ensure that the code is running properly.\n",
    "4. Create a dataframe for aggregation of data"
