By using your Metamask wallet, RAMP Defi allows you to stake your assets and generate very high APY's on many tokens, through many blockchains such as BSC, Ethereum or Polygon. Solana and Avalanche chains are in development. With the above method, I have been staking my RAMP tokens for over half a year now and the amount of tokens I now own have increased by over 20%. Finally their marketing campaign has been increasing, with beautifully animated video's explaining their use cases. The entire staking method I just described is also explained in one of their recent video's: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MpYmENp3HM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MpYmENp3HM)

More pros include:

17,CryptoCurrency,ridnovir," I have been lurking on this board for a while and decided to contribute. I am taking SEC Reg class in law school now and want to share one very illuminating document. As most of you know SEC is the primary regulator of securities in the US and it will decide whether or not particular crypto is a security. Most of you may have heard of the so-called Howey test that SEC will employ to make this determination. However, the analysis that SEC will employ will go much deeper than that and will incorporate numerous important factors.

A body with SEC - the Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub) coordinates the agency’s oversight and response regarding emerging technologies in financial, regulatory, and supervisory systems ie deals with crypto. FinHub serves as a public resource for information about the SEC’s views and actions related to FinTech innovation. Here is a link to the paper by FinHub that lays out the analytical framework of how SEC will evaluate if a cryptocurrency project is a security:

 [Here is the Document](https://www.sec.gov/files/dlt-framework.pdf)

23,CryptoCurrency,kirtash93,"Welcome to **Round 33 of the Cryptotrivial 2021 contest**!

# Question 33: When the majority of peers on the network are malicious and monopolize the network in order to prevent specific nodes from receiving information from honest nodes. 

The correct answer of **Round 32** is...

# Bollinger Bands!

**What are Bollinger Bands:**

The Bollinger Bands, or BB, were developed in the 1980s by financial analyst and trader John Bollinger. Since then, many traders and chartists have been using the BB as a technical analysis (TA) indicator.In essence, the Bollinger Bands function as a measurement tool of market oscillations. As such, the BB indicator can be used to identify the moments that a particular market presents high or low volatility. Also, they can be useful for spotting potential overbought or oversold market conditions.

The BB indicator consists of two sidelong bands and a middle line. These three elements indicate how prices more around an average value, which is represented by the middle band. The upper and lower bands expand when market volatility is high, and contract when market volatility is low. They either move away from the middle band (high volatility) or towards it (low volatility).

The Bollinger Bands are among the most used TA indicators, especially in traditional financial markets. However, they are also used by cryptocurrency traders. Still, BB should not be used as a stand-alone tool but rather in conjunction with other TA tools and indicators, to decrease the overall risks.

There are a few basic ways of reading and interpreting the information provided by the BB indicator. 

For instance, imagine that the price of an asset moves from below the middle line all the way up to the upper band, surpassing it. This would indicate a potential overbought condition. The same reading logic applies to the opposite side. If an asset’s price exceeds the lower band, it may be indicative of oversold conditions. The upper and lower bands may also suggest potential support and resistance levels, in which the price is likely to bounce.

Other than that, the movement of the upper and lower bands in relation to the middle line is a very important factor of the BB indicator. The expansion and contraction of the bands may come handy when traders and chartists are trying to predict the next periods of market volatility (or lack thereof). 

For example, if the volatility starts increasing, the bands will expand and move away from the middle line. In contrast, if the market volatility decreases, the bands will contract and move towards the middle.

29,CryptoCurrency,Unitedpantieairline,"Its risky to trade. I would never suggest day trading because it wont work with crypto as easily as you think because of high volatility at least not for now since were still early.

If you want to trade i suggest only sell when you know your asset has pumped or take profits on the way up and when it drops significantly you buy back in.

Also remember when you do trade you need to keep track of your transactions for tax purposes it’s always safe to do bookkeeping.

Other than that if you take a look at previous bull runs and this one you can see just by holding even the low caps they slowly pull up as bitcoin goes sideways at times. These few months i think most things will move up regardless, it will take little % down but most will hold and move up as well.

The main advantage I see here is that land is actually of finite scarcity, on the contrary of $ (and gold on a smaller scale).

This is how I'm picturing it:
A fund buys a huge land property somewhere, for example 1M acres, and sells 1M token (1/acre) at double or triple the cost.
They have to sell it at a higher price, because the land needs investments in order to be managed in a sustainable and profitable way.

Then if you buy a token, part of this token represents the land and another part represents the capital linked to that land.

If the exploitation of the land earns money, it is added to the value
If the land value varies, it should also be reflected on the token price.

I feel this would be a safe haven in bear markets, plus it could be great for the planet's ecosystem if it's made properly, with a good governance system and sustainability as a core value.

Also, Classification of earnings from the crypto assets as business income or capital gains completely depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, said Singhania. If an individual is trading frequently in such assets or his livelihood is dependent on the income from trading in cryptocurrencies, then such earnings are classified as business income.

With Shib hitting a new ATH, it seems that many people in this sub are upset that the coin itself didn’t go crashing down and losing everyone’s money. But this confuses me because majority of people looked down on the coin instead of just taking a bit of lottery money and tossing it in for the heck of it like how everyone else is.

First, I would disclose that I tossed 300$ in the project around March. And I seen that grow to immense sense amounts and also fall insanely just as quick. Yes, I held despite looking at all the posts saying “scam, rug pulls... etc.” but at the end of the day, it was just a experiment in crypto. The fundamentals are not as “professional” or solid as other coins, but the coin has still delivered on its projects that it promised the people. Instead, people still called it a shitcoin.

Why do people let their pride get in their way of making money? Many companies know the coin has so much hype around it that it be foolish for them to not list it. The amount that was made from doge itself by robinhood was insane and I have a feeling the same can be said around this coin.

Just be happy for those that invested because they risked their money. And their money is just as hard earned as your money.

Now if you feel like you missed out, wait for the coin to stabilize or drop, and just toss some spare into it so that next time when it pulls the unthinkable, at least you are in it for the ride too.

But the problem is many of you newbies don’t understand MC I just got flamed for pointing out to two people that shiba will not EVER hit a penny (.01). I was accused of it being just like BTC to 10k and doge to 50 cent. Okay no shib is like neither of those. 

Let’s revisit market cap shall we? The market cap is a metric we use to compare coins to one another it’s THE thing to check when you want to know potential price action of a coin. MC= circulating supply x current market price. BTC is the #1 coin at 1.1T (1 decimal place) MC. You can calculate that with $60,300 (current Market price) x 17 million (circulating supply). No one with a brain should believe your coin will surpass this. 

Let’s look at shib shall we. A current MC of 17 billion. It’s got some room to run sure. Will it get to a penny? No shot. Why? MC. To get to 1 cent shib will need to 238x from here. That would be a market cap of 17B x 238 = over 4T. All of crypto is currently 2.55T. It’s NOT HAPPENING THIS RUN. 

If you are new I hope this helps cause I doubt your influencer who told you to buy explained this. If you made money great but no your $50 will not 300x you will not hit $1 the supply continues to go up daily making it even harder.

118,CryptoCurrency,kirtash93,"Welcome to **Round 32 of the Cryptotrivial 2021 contest**!

# Question 32: A technical analysis indicator that measures market volatility. It's made of two sidelong bands and a simple moving average.  

The correct answer of **Round 31** is...

# Block Header!

**What is a Block Header:**

The block header is a section in a block that serves as a summary of the rest of the block. It’s made up of all the metadata – such as the time and difficulty when the block was mined, the Merkle root of the included transactions, and the nonce. Also present is the previous block’s hash, which is what allows us to create the “chain” of blocks. In essence, the block header contains any data that isn’t the list of raw transactions itself.

A block header is what the miners hash to try and make the block valid. This is a lot more efficient than hashing the entirety of the block, which can be made up of thousands of transactions. It would be vastly more cumbersome for a miner to change the nonce and to rehash a whole 2MB block for every attempt. Compare this with hashing Bitcoin’s block headers, for instance, which have a fixed length of 80 bytes. 

Block headers are great from a mining point of view, but because of their small size, they’re also ideal for light clients. The Bitcoin blockchain is too large for devices like smartphones to store. If the chain had 100,000 1MB blocks, you’d consume 100GB of space. But with just the block headers for those same blocks, you’d only take up 0.008GB, or 8MB.

In this way, devices with less bandwidth or storage space can still perform some degree of validation. Because the Merkle root encapsulates all of the transactions, they can later check whether a transaction was included in a particular block. This does come at a cost – the user must still rely on a third party to provide them with necessary information. With that said, light clients are preferable to a system where the users perform no verification at all.

I have been considering just buying the top 10 coins per marketcap and this every month like 500 dollars with 25 percent for BTC and ETH and the other 50 percent for the 8 other coins.

With that I am expecting to have some gains at least on some coins and avoid FOMOing everywhere and instead I would do a check every end of month and sell the ones that didn't perform well  and rebalance for again the 10 new marketcap (removing tether and maybe take another coin like ONE or FTM that has also promising uptrend).

Now I wonder on which plateform doing that, because I have Jade card for Crypto.com and I have one or two coins on Binance and Kraken.

For me crypto.com seems easier because I usually top up anyway every months for my groceries on it so adding a little bit more would avoid me transfering twice. But the spread is shit. Is that difficult to transfert to exchange en then use exchange?

# What is it?

EOS is a blockchain platform designed to develop decentralized applications (DApps). Its operation is similar to the Ethereum platform, with the exception that it is faster and more scalable. It enable developers to build decentralized applications more efficiently. EOS is a project strongly focused on solving many of the problems of blockchain technology, especially from those who keep it away from massification and global adoption. To achieve this, it has a number of fundamental pillars to satisfy, they are:

* **Free use:** the platform must offer flexibility to developers and users to offer free services. This indicates a more widespread adoption of the technology.
* **Recovery from errors:** the platform must be robust enough to correct errors when they inevitably occur.
* **Sequential performances:** there are some applications that simply cannot be implemented with parallel algorithms due to sequential dependent steps. For this reason, the platform must support fast sequential performance.
* **Parallel performance:** large-scale applications need to divide the workload across multiple CPUs and computers.

# How does it work?

In this aspect, EOS is similar to Ethereum. The capabilities of both to enable distributed application development are immense. However, there are important technical points where EOS has some advantage.  Among these points are:

* Ability to provide accounts, authentication systems and databases.
* Asynchronous communication between nodes.
* Parallel application programming to exploit the potential of multiple CPU cores and / or clusters.
* High scalability.
* Elimination of fees and commissions.
* Quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications.
* Simple upgrade system.
* Error recovery.

Another important point is that it has a consensus protocol designed for high scalability. In developing EOS, the team decided to implement the **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).** In this way, all those who possess EOS tokens will be able to choose to produce blocks thanks to a voting and approval system. Money production is permissive. That is, a user can produce blocks in proportion to the votes he accumulates. The network can produce one block every 0.5 seconds and batches of 126 blocks every time.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallet for EOS are Scatter, EOS-voter, SimplEOS and Exodus If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger is the right choice

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. High scalability
2. Great roadmap and devs team
3. Low transaction fees

**Cons**

1. Transactions are not anonymous
2. Not completely decentralized",KnowYourCrypto #39: Eos (EOS),1635088639

If you want a reliable goal I would consider investing in functional alt coins.  Meme coins usually don't last past one or two pumps.  Currently I am invested in Proton,  and if you have the MetalPay app there are little to no fees from withdrawing.  I take out 50$ a day and I end up keeping 45.50.  Even better its instant transactions during business days so don't worry about the 3-5 day crap.  Also the Proton team will respond super quickly if you have an issue and email them.  They are also very active in r/Protonchain.

This is just a small example,  but crytpos like this are going to survive the long run.  Functionality is getting stronger too as the big coins show their flaws.  These types of coins are going to aggressively compete with each other,  and if you want a long lasting and solid community these are the ones to invest in.","Those of you upset about SHIB, functional alt coins will probably become popular again soon.",1635089052
168,CryptoCurrency,jgarcya,"In our current lifetime.... We are seeing one of the greatest wealth transfers in all of history...

Yes coins like bitcoin and ethereum are rewarding the early adopters....

But then we have meme coins like doge and shiba elevating the poor to new heights...

Why is this....

Because poor people, like myself, feel as if the crypto train has left us behind... Unless you were lucky enough to get in before April 2020.

So the poor look for that gamble... They can't buy 1 btc, but $400 buys you 10,000,000 shiba inu.

Then we start thinking.... Well all I need to be rich is 

10,000,000 x .01 is $100,000

100,000,000 shibe. X .001 is $100,000

But 100,000,000 x .01 is $1,000,000.....

This is how we are thinking.... Desperate to get out of poverty.. A prayer, and a dream.

I'm not endorsing shitcoins... But I am watching and a part of what is happening...

Then we start to see huge amounts of money being moved into these coins.... I'm talking $100's of millions of dollars...

The price spikes overnight..... 

Yesterday 10,000,000 shiba cost $280, today $410...

A few months ago you could get 100,000,000 shibes for this price....

The moderate conservative crypto invester at first... Laughs, then they mock, but after seeing 300-1000's% gain, they join in...

Market cap shoots up billions over night... 2 meme coins are in the top 15...

More money from the middle class and upper class join in...

Now memes are flying...

Poor people that put in a few hundred bucks are now worth $10,000- $100,000's... A few millionaires are made.

As the frenzy continues.... More zeros are dropped of the price... Now it takes more money to make less returns... But people are greedy.

Now a meme that way 10,000th of a penny are now 1000th of a penny.... More millionaires are created from a few $1000 investment.

It's happening before our eyes... We seen it with doge, from ..004 to .74 in less than a year.... Now shibe removed 2 zeros in a year.

Like it or not, but the great wealth transfer has begun... The rich and middle class are handing money over to the poor fist over fist...

The very rich are making 100-300% returns in bitcoin... While the poor are making 1000's-10,000's% on memes..

I'm not endorsing memes.... It's very risky... But I'm holding both doge n shiba... And am experiencing the shift directly...

I know there will come a time where they may disappear, maybe by the end of the 4yr cycle....

But in the meantime people are getting rich! Thank you FOMO'S.... And late comers.

Tl:dr

Meme coins are taking money from middle class, wealthy, fomo'ers.... And giving it to the poor via meme coins.",Crypto currency... The great shift,1635089099

179,CryptoCurrency,FutureIsCrypto,"As I was reading the front page this morning, there was a particular comment that really hit me. I don't remember who it was but they said something along the lines of ""***how we feel about SHIBA-INU's growth and how it is fundamentally, is the same way how non-crypto people view us***."" This hit me like a train in that it rings very true. Think of how many people you have talked to about cryptocurrency (if any) and have questioned its use-case, legitimacy, value, etc. Of course, some will agree and that's awesome. However the ones that don't agree will later go on to spread ill-will towards crypto because they have missed out and most likely are somewhat jealous. I will admit, I still struggle with this from time to time. 

For us, we viewed Doge and SHIB as meme coins who were supposed to be nothing more than a pump and dump or, just speculative fun. I think for most of us, we feel somewhat jealous that the hours we spent researching our coins were in vain as we see coins such as these rise significantly in value while our coins are down. In the back of our minds I think we all wanted to take a small chance on them but were too hesitant to invest based on what the majority of people were saying here. Instead of the ill-feelings towards the people who have made some nice gains, we should congratulate them on their success and having some **diamond balls** lol. 

Look back at when you first entered the cryptoverse. You took a speculative chance, gamble, risk, or however you want to word it against what the majority of people were telling you. Chances are, you have done pretty damn well up to this point. It's no different than what people who have invested in Doge or SHIB have done. They went ***against the majority*** and came out on the other end a whole lot richer. In the end, our profits from any coin are most likely going to flow back into the market as we chase more gains. Unless you want to buy that Lambo, then as r/Wallstreetbets would say... fuck you and good job.

If we want to hit that 10 trillion dollar market cap for crypto as a whole, we need to be unified and hype each other up when gains are made or help each other out when we bleed from the rear. Remember speculate, but also have some common sense from time to time like investing in 69cumrocketapeshitlongtothemooncoin.

The filings note that the SEC attorneys then advised Terraform Labs that “enforcement action was warranted” on Sep. 15, 2021. Kwon was served with the subpoenas at Mainnet five days later. 

Kwon’s lawsuit contests the SEC’s request for him to provide testimony to U.S. regulators, arguing that he is a resident of South Korea. It also takes issue with the way the subpoenas were served: SEC rules state that investigations should be confidential, but the agency hired a group called the Cavalier Courier &amp; Process Service to serve him the subpoenas at the event. A note in the lawsuit reads: 

“Hiring a “Cavalier” process to approach Mr. Kwon in public, and announce the purpose of his approach, at a summit attended by more than 2,000 people was, at worst, an intentionally brazen display meant to publicly intimidate and embarrass, and at best reckless, creating social media and press speculation about the incident within minutes of the attempted service of process.”

The one disadvantage I see is the inelasticity of a crypto currency with a fixed amount in circulation. Economists regularly argue that a currency should be able to expand to meet the needs of trade. The problem is that when you have a group of people deciding when to expand it and by how much, then human error plays a role (i.e. it can be over printed beyond the legitimate needs of the economy). So why not a crypto currency that has the decentralized advantage combined with the advantages of a currency that can expand as needed?

I say almost any awareness is a good thing, especially somewhere as mainstream as Walmart.

In the article they mention about concerns over the possibilities of money laundering. I think this is laughable, with a purchase limit of $2,500 and under the watch of CCTV, I doubt they will be catching many high-level crooks.

Yes 11% commission is very high indeed, but if it is a safe and easy to use service perhaps that is somewhat justified. Can't exactly see it being a big hit, but if more people buy Bitcoin, I'm happy.",You can now buy Bitcoin at Walmart [adoption],1635000940

So you look at your portfolio and it's worth millions or whatever magic number is your make it number. Now what? Do you immediately cash out to fiat or stable realizing your gains? What about the tax implications, you know Uncle Sam wants his fair share. Do you contact your financial advisor to book a meeting and discuss best course of action? But Crypto is volatile by the time you do that your gains could be gone. Hmm maybe you're thinking screw the IRS, do you convert your Crypto to monero and get in a ""boating accident""?

Then what about celebration let's face it we would be so excited that we'd have to tell someone! Can't keep all this excitement to ourselves. Do you immediately hop on social media and let everybody know you're a millionaire? Got to show off your gains and flex on everyone. With the possibility of making yourself a target? Or do you only tell wives and inner circle? Do you trust your inner circle to not tell others or set up an elaborate plan to kill you and get your private keys?

And what about transfer to an exchange? Do you true your test transaction? Or do you do multiple test transactions? Do you send your Crypto all at once? 

And how about deposit it to your bank if you decide to go that route. Would they put the transfer on hold? Isn’t strange that someone with $11.37 in their bank account is depositing 1 million. Would they think you’re dealing drugs?

237,CryptoCurrency,No_Weather682,"**1-** **Thinking that a coin with very low price has greater potential**

I’ve seen too many people saying “If Bitcoin is at $60.000 it shouldn’t be very difficult for SHIBA INU to reach $1”. Nope, that’s not how it works. You can’t compare the price of cryptocurrencies by their USD value, because they have different amounts in supply. 

**2-** **Not having a strategic plan**

This is a common mistake made by many beginners that start investing before having a plan. They end up buying too late or selling too early for not having an entrance/exit strategy.

**3-** **Getting Scared of Market Volatility**

You can’t expect a 10x in your portfolio if you can’t handle a +20% loss. A lot of newbies get scared of market volatility and end up panic selling. But if you want to stick around you need to understand that cryptocurrencies are very volatile.

**4-** **Falling for Scams**

There are all types of scams (influencers promoting a scam coin, fake emails or fake promotions), but it’s crucial to recognize them if you don’t want to lose all your money. Why would a random person double the amount of money you send him? Exactly, never give personal information to nobody. 

**5-** **Being too lazy to DYOR**

Too many people want to get rich in crypto yet are too lazy to do mínimum research.  If you don’t understand the crypto you’re investing in and only listen to “experts”, you will get into big trouble and lose a lot of money.

**6-** **Investing money they can’t afford to lose**

A lot of beginners throw all their savings or loan funds to crypto without considering that they could lose it. Always remember, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.

**7-** **FOMO’ing/FUD**

Falling for FOMO or FUD is something that almost everyone fall for when entering the crypto space. It’s important to not fall for emotions when investing/trading so you don’t get too greedy and end up losing money.

**8-** **Not diversifying**

You should diversify even when you think you’ve found a sure thing, it simply doesn’t hurt you to have more variety. On the other hand, when you’re starting in crypto you should stick to a few crypto with good fundamentals that you clearly understand them.

**9-** **Trading**

If you’re not a professional, just stick to investing. All you have to do is buy,hodl and DCA, you will not time the market so strop trying to sell at peak prices.

**10-**  **Following trends**

“What coin is everyone talking about this week? Ok I will buy it”. Too many people just follow trends, and when their shitcoin trend is starting to lose popularity, they jump into another trend. A good investor often does not get carried away with the trend set by whales or twitter accounts.

Personally I have been investing in alt coins and doing well (Bought Sol at 110, Ava at 46, Fantom at 1.4 to mention a few). But I want to further improve my investment skills and not just invest in projects once they’re more mainstream or break in to top 10/25.

Do you conduct both technical and fundamental analysis as you would for stocks?

266,CryptoCurrency,fuzzyduck88,"So to start I want to clarify: this is NOT for tax purposes or ANYTHING to do with tax. Also as a matter of FACT this would also NOT be classed as money laundering as one of the proofs for money laundering is that the money was the “proceeds of criminal conduct”. It’s fully legal to hide any legitimate money. Please don’t turn it into a conversation about anything illegal. There are strict rules here. 

This came to light from a conversation I was having with a friend about divorce and the the age old myth of losing your keys “in a boating accident” so that you wouldn’t have to give away half. 

I’m not getting divorced or anything. This was about a famous person who had recently been divorced and practically lost everything and how he could have avoided it. 

Although there’s no way of proving the keys weren’t lost in an accident I don’t believe this would last in court given the burden of proof in civil cases is only based on probability. If it would be safe to say “given the facts heard, he probably didn’t lose the keys”…then you’re screwed. 
This is obviously different to a criminal case where it has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 

So, back to the beginning. How would one hide their crypto so it’s impossible for someone with full access to your bank accounts to to determine if you own some or not?(I.e - they can see you deposited money on an exchange). Or is it even possible?

My theory was the best way is to “muddy the waters” to an extent that it just becomes impossible to determine where the money is. (was it spent, gambled, invested further etc). To do this would mean spending a bit on fees:

(1)Transfer from exchange to a private wallet.
(2) Transfer from wallet to gambling site
(3) Transfer from gambling site to another wallet. 
(4) Transfer from wallet to a new unused hardware wallet such as trezor etc. 
(5) Bury wallet for years.

If you are making profit on a coin and want to cash out so you can invest in another always use the convert option. When you sell and invest in another coin there is the fee you will pay. The fee equals losing money, not a lot depending on how much you are cashing out but that fee can go in another coin instead of losing it. When you convert your profit to another coin you get more of that coin than you would selling and buying that coin. 

I've been doing this the whole time since I've been I crypto and it has compounded my money over time. I'm not going to lie, I cashed out once and realized I made a amateur mistake. Only cash out if you need the money

After researching how criminals use cryptocurrency to evade taxes, and launder money, I decided to see what else criminals use to do illegal things. 

I found that many are using the ocean by placing boats on it to transport drugs, weapons, and stolen goods.     

  If you support using the ocean , you support it's existence, and as long as we keep using the ocean to fish, going on trips, and swim, we are indirectly telling criminals that they have the ability to use the ocean too...  For their illegal activities.  And I'm taking a stand now, and never using the ocean for anything again. 

The fact is, deep in international waters, there isn't much regulation.  There isn't enough eyes on it, and anything can be going on out there.    Especially pirates.  

So one someone tells you they like going in the ocean, remind them of all the illegal things that take place in it.    They should feel bad.     Educate them on the dangers.","Because of Cryptocurrency, I'm never going to be able to swim in the ocean ever again.",1635003303

Later that evening I ended up coming across the most ludicrous new released shitcoin I had ever seen on Binance Scam Chain. And figured I’d throw a $100 as that’s what I would have spent on the night out. 

This was just purely for shits and giggles and I forgot about it a week later I checked the charts of the shitcoin just to see how much it would be down only to find out it had gone on an insane run and I was in profit to the tune of thousands of dollars. 

Of course I took out 40x my investment and let the rest ride as a clown market shit happens insurance. But as I was cashing out in increments as I had enough to completely tank the price.

I joined the Telegram just to see if there was any news. And nope zero news whatsoever... just a ton of shilling and hype and getting new suckers to buy into the shitcoin with zero usecase. Someone new would ask if they are still early and how to buy and all the shillers would say “it’s the next Shib” and “hop in don’t miss the 1000x”. 

And seeing all the buy orders with some people throwing in thousands I just felt bad. As I was dumping my bags to the next lineup of idiots while making a killing. And the pump is unsustainable so they will likely be left holding their bags.

# Problem 1:

The issue of double spending in electronic currency - a phenomenon in which a single unit of currency is spent simultaneously more than once.

**Solution**: 

Bitcoin - a decentralised community consensus mechanism, where nodes are incentivised to act honestly in order to maintain a common, universal ledger system where all the transactions are verified and recorded (blockchain).

# Problem 2: 

Now we have digital currency, but it lacks other functions such as sophisticated smart contracts that can be programmed with business logic, i.e. a bond that pays out automatically on certain dates.

**Solution**: 

Ethereum - an open source software platform based on blockchain technology that allows developers to build and run decentralised applications (dApps) using programmable smart contracts.

# Problem 3: 

Now we have a digital currency and programmable smart contracts, but for REAL world use they need to be connected to external data inputs that can trigger smart contracts, i.e. did you receive your delivery, what's the current cost of a gallon of fuel, what is the weather in a certain location AND we need to fulfil payments through legacy payment systems (VISA, MasterCard, PayPal etc.)

**Solution:** 

Chainlink - the Chainlink network provides reliable tamper-proof inputs and outputs for complex smart contracts (80% of all smart contract use case) on ANY BLOCKCHAIN using a community consensus model for verifying external data from the real world where those validating stake their own collateral (LINK token) as an incentive to act honestly.

It's like we're ALL stupid here, but there's that ONE guy who has figured it out and he tells us how extremely annoyed he is by us Kindergardeners. He has seen the light and like in Plato's Allegory of the cave (The philosophical thing, not the porn with Lana rhoades and Mia Khalifa) he is willing to descend down to us into the cave to free us from our chains and to educate us.

He has seen the light and brings us the news of the beautiful world he has seen, where we stop a certain behavior that he thinks is unbefitting for the likes of us. Like he has seen so much of it, that he goes out of his way and takes some time to create a post about something that we REALLY need to stop. For ... reasons. He doesn't like it mainly. That's the main reason. It's not good for crypto also. It's bad for crypto, if we behave like that. And all the while he angrily slaps his pc with a wet towel and screams at birds that fly by.  


But we're not better. We all flock to this kind of post and MANY of us address criticism like it's always a good thing. Like the person criticizing actually has a point and not crayons in his ass. What drives us and gives us a wrong motiviation to do so, is our need to be smart and understanding and willing to change. Up to a point where no change is required. Because we think, being like that makes us better traders or hodlers.  


But remember this: The complaining person has thought about this vor a while! He's slept his PC many many times and came up with arguments, why we should stop a certain behavior. Some of them arguments are not even bad. Which means, we'll be impressed and immediatelly think: ""That's one smart guy! He certainly is hung and has lots of Cryptos."" But if we stop for a moment and think about Counter-Arguments, there almost always are! And often there are very good reasons why we behave like we do.  


Keep that in mind. It's a general thing. I know this, because I have seen the light and I wanted to descend down the cave to tell you about it. So STOP listening to people who want to tell you to stop something, and who clearly think of themselves as something better!

In Telegram of Mises, a discussion on decentralization started yesterday. We found it very insightful therefore we re-organized the text and share it here.

Yesterday, a community member asked a few questions on our solution towards illegal content, triggering a Q&amp;A. We found this discussion very insightful. Therefore, it will be presented to you in the following paragraphs.

Q: How does the local node determine what's illegal or not? And how do the nodes apply to those laws?

A: Nodes will comply with the laws of their home countries and will be punished if they are reported for non-compliance. And also, community members will play an important role in the governance.

Q:That's a serious risk i guess, if I try to decide to allow illegal content. Also, “People’s accounts and data are not in their own hands.” .. and Mises would solve that issue I guess.. But checking content by a node (certainly if its done manually) before it gets posted.. I think this breaks what Mises try to solve?

A: The content will not be only stored on one node, there will be a lot of nodes. If, for example, a pic violates the law where a node is located, this node will delete this pic on its storage, but not the other nodes. If user post content which is considered illegal all around the word, then it shouldn’t be public, right? And we think how a node acts depends on the people that run this node, they can also decide to accept all the content even if facing a potential legal problem. And we think this is how freedom and regulation reach the equilibrium, by game.

Q: I understand, but “the nodes think” again.. how do they “think” .. how do they check the content when its encrypted? There is no preview you said. How can the node owner decide and check what's illegal or not? so send a request to a node would require a preview of the content right, otherwise, again…. how does the node knows whats illegal?

A: The chances that your content would trigger reviewing depends on the people who run the node. Most people would not want to host content which is illegal in their resident country, but some people don’t.

362,CryptoCurrency,MistaBud,"So I think I'm starting to understand NFTs a bit better. The whole NFT image craze has soured the idea for me. But I got to thinking of alternative uses. Please read, and tell me I'm understanding the basic principle of the concept. This is not a  proof of concept, but I'm asking if my thought process is correct.

\---

Personal Information NFTs

Everyone knows that any personal information is valuable to advertising. Currently, data is mined from users, often with no consent, then sold, and then purchased by advertising giants who in turn, sell you their products. What I propose is an opt-in advertisement based NFT. Information that the token holder provides can be stored to the blockchain.

Participating websites can read the data, enabling targeted advertisements to the user based upon said data.

Basic Example

John is willing to share the following info: First Name, Age, Country, State, Sex, Hobbies, Income. So John visits a site, the site reads the blockchain, and finds his PINFT . The site then knows that John loves baseball, is a 25 year old male, and has disposable income. So it displays an advertisement for BigBobsSportsEmporium.com.

Advantages for Advertisers

They can target ads to its users that own the NFT. If the NFT can be verified on the blockchain, then the advertiser can pay per ad, and have it automatically deduct the required fees from their own wallet. Eliminates additional 3rd parties that supply the information. All verified and signed by automated contracts.

Advantages for Holders

The holder of the NFT gains the benefit of advertisements that are targeted to their needs. Part of the fees that are paid by advertisers go directly to the holder. It is a reward that is given to entice the holder to keep holding the NFT.

Benefits of developing on the Safemoon Blockchain (i know I'm gunna get hate from this part)

Safemoon Blockchain (SMBC) is chosen due to the uniqueness of reflections. In essence, SMBC entices the users to hold onto any token on that system by rewarding the user with a percentage of taxed transactions. By keeping the NFT and not removing it will give the user additional reflections. The reflections can then be sold/traded/used as fees by the user. They will keep getting reflections during the period that the NFT is held.

Fees

It is unclear if initial token generation fees would be covered by either the user or the advertiser. Cost would be minimal to either party. If user generated, they would have to pay, but they could recoup their losses by gaining the reflections, and also by the payments for advertisers. If paid by advertisers, it could possibly be expensive if users make multiple, unneeded NFTs, but zero cost to the user would encourage user participation. 

Summary

By encouraging users to hold the NFT, they will gain income for holding, and the advertisers have willing participants, who in turn buy their products. All that is needed is the NFT held by users, an application that can read the chain, and verify what data is stored, and the app/website then can request targeted ads to display. It can be done safely, securely, anonymously, and cheaply. It will reduce costs for advertisers, and also rewards holders by fees paid by advertisers.

I am not asking if this is a viable product, but is the idea itself something the blockchain tech and NFTs can do. Thoughts?",Questions regarding NFT uses.,1634915824
365,CryptoCurrency,xMrCrash,"As many of you will remember, two public pension funds from Fairfax County in Virginia previously invested in the first two Morgan Creek Digital funds. They were the first public pension funds to allocate to the industry. These were venture funds that had approximately 15-20% invested in bitcoin.

After Fairfax, there was only one other pension fund that I’m aware of that had invested in the industry - the Municipal Employees’ Retirement System of Michigan allocated to Dan Tapiero’s 10T Holdings growth equity fund.

Each of these three public pension funds were investing in venture capital style funds, even if they had some bitcoin exposure, simply because there was no clear framework for them to safely place the digital assets directly in their portfolio. Does bitcoin go in their currency allocation? Maybe commodities? Or maybe it is digital real estate? There has been no clear answer. So venture funds made sense because everyone understood that the allocation went in the venture capital bucket.

This is all changing though. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are maturing to the point where public pension funds, along with financial institutions and corporations, are all comfortable holding the assets directly. They understand which bucket in their asset allocation to put them into. And the infrastructure is now available where institutions don’t have to worry about custody, insurance, or accounting support.

The market has matured significantly since 2018. Even with all this progress though, it is still a big moment when the very first public pension puts bitcoin on their balance sheet. Eventually every pension fund is going to do it.

The argument has always been simple. Bitcoin is a non-correlated, asymmetric asset that would allow a pension fund to make a small allocation, while still having an outsized impact on the portfolio. This was true when bitcoin was around $3,500 and it is true when bitcoin is trading around $65,000 today.

We still have a long way to go in educating public pension investment teams, their investment committee board members, and the general public who is made up of pensioneers. But we’re making great progress towards the inevitable end. Pension funds are not going to be able to fulfill their obligations, so they have to do something different.

I like our chances. The Houston Firefighters Pension Fund should get immense congratulations for their courage and conviction in this decision.","It was confirmed yesterday that the Houston Firefighters Pension Fund has officially become the first pension fund in the United States to purchase, and directly hold, bitcoin in their portfolio.",1634915957

On the news of AP setting up a chainlink node yesterday, there has been a lot of FUD thrown around both on Reddit and on Twitter. I'm going to do my best to lay out the biggest concerns I've seen and my opinion on whether they're as concerning as they seem.

1 - Oracles shouldn't need a token

2 - The devs control a lot of the token supply

3 - The devs sell off tokens they own at regular intervals

4 - Gatekeeping data providers and validators

5 - PoA Vs PoS



1 - In an ideal world, yes, an oracle shouldn't need a token. Unfortunately, the best legal way to ensure that data is good quality is to financially incentivise it. This is a pretty simple and effective way to ensure that the data providers and validators aren't trying to game the system by providing poor data to allow for market manipulation or just to cause anarchy for the fun of it.

Chainlink is PoA, which makes people question why it needs its own token and it doesn't just use a stable coin or ETH. The short answer is that if a stable coin fails, then so does anything reliant on it (see issues with Tether...) and if it used ETH then it creates issues if other ecosystems want to use the oracle.


2 &amp; 3 - these 2 are kind of in the same answer. Yes the devs still own a lot of the token, however they are doing what any start-up has done since the dawn of business as we know it, they're funding the project through selling off shares in the project, in this case via tokens. 
The fact they are gradually selling off shows that it is a measured and considered approach that is extremely unlikely to be rug pull. 

Concerns over the devs having a large number of tokens should also be assured by the fact that Chainlink is PoA, this is addressed below in point 5.


4 - Chainlink requires KYC for its data. This, in my opinion, shouldn't worry anyone, the idea that the providers of data or the original sources of data are known should be something that assuages FUD, not produce it. 
This means that Chainlink will require the data providers to prove they are reputable prior to providing the data. If anyone could provide data, then an oracle providing real world data to a smart contract could be manipulated thereby defeating the point of the oracle and the contract.


5 - Chainlink is Proof of Authority, there are concerns that this makes Chainlink too centralised because, as mentioned above, it requires the data providers and validators to be known and approved based upon their reputation to provide and validate the data (for example, AP will be setting up a node to provide data and will be allowed to do so based upon the fact they have a reputation for providing that data historically), which means the pool of data providers can be restricted. Whilst this could be problematic if the data providers were manipulated to provide false data, the fact that there is monetary incentive and multiple good quality data sources mitigates this. 
Most of the data we get today is from a relatively small number of news and data sources, it's not like this will severely restrict the current data providers unless they have a bad track record for being truthful with data.

A PoS project relies on most no single entity being able to possess greater than 50% of the token supply as this would mean that they could theoretically attack the network and put it at risk of failure. Because Chainlink doesn't have a blockchain and it requires proof that you can provide the high quality data you say you can, it doesn't make sense to have PoS.

I have a model one and really like it. I wanted a backup device so rather than get another model one I thought it would be cool to upgrade to the T.

During the setup process the unit froze up during the firmware update and I was forced to unplug after many hours of making sure it wasn't just taking a really long time. After that the unit never recovered.

I contacted support and they did get back to me via email and we ran through some different ways to solve the problem. I did them all, sent screen shots, described the issues but still the unit was not working.

The final request from support was for me to film myself running through some of these solutions, I guess to prove that I was doing it correctly. I'm in retail, so I get it that people can be difficult and a lot of the time it's the user not the hardware, but I felt that having to video myself was too far. It's a $200 dollar unit so I'm bummed that it's not going to work for me, and I get that I'm the one giving up but I think if we are going to onboard more people to self custody and make people feel comfortable storing their Crypto on these devices the support needs to do better.

1. Data breaches had already affected millions of us. In my country (Malaysia), back in 2017, the data from our major telcos were stolen, and sold. We had 30 million people in our country, and data for 42 million people were allegedly stolen and sold.
2. Data breaches is inevitable, and lets assume that your data is already out there with people ready to use your data without your consent. 

Moving towards 'Data is the new gold' era, **would you voluntarily mint your personal data via NFT, and have people who wants to get/use your data pay you for a certain amount to send you messages/news-mail letters?** 

Therefore, you should know who has your data. In the event you receive a marketing call, or a scam call, you therefore know they are using it without your consent.  

I can take an example, though this is just based on what I know as of today. You could sell your personal information similar to how **NFT Event Tickets** are sold.

In this case, a digital ticket of your personal information is a programmable NFT, and you can build a royalty split which allows a profit sharing/payment system.

You can therefore creating an 'Allowed' list in your **NFT Personal Information Ticket** allotment to remember who had bought the rights to your information. Those who are not in the 'allowed' list should not be accessing or had access to your data.

391,CryptoCurrency,Veridiyus,"I always see people bash gold when compared to Bitcoin but I truly believe that both assets have a spot in ones portfolio. 

If we compare gold to other metals and Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies we can clearly see that both serve as hedge against inflation or in other words, they are both safe-haven assets. You can honestly think of precious metals as money of the past and Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general as money of the future. It is clear that Bitcoin shares properties with gold hence why it's called digital gold.

Gold has dominated as the go-to asset against inflation for hundreds of years while bitcoin was launched just over a decade ago and has only achieved a fraction of what gold has achieved, so far. But even then, Bitcoin shows no signs of stopping.

Thanks to its encrypted, decentralized system and very complicated algorithms, Bitcoin is very difficult to corrupt just like gold thanks to its established system for trading, tracking and weighing which is, lack of a better word, pristine. While Bitcoin's infrastructure to ensure its safety isn't fully fleshed out yet, I believe that it will at some point reach gold standard. Both gold and bitcoin are considered rare resources and gold has historically been used in many applications from specialized applications in electronics to luxury items and more. Bitcoin on the other hand, together with the blockchain technology, has a huge baseline value. A huge portion of the population, if not the majority, lack access to proper banking infrastructure and traditional means of finance. Bitcoin allow these people to send value anywhere they'd like for less than a fraction of what a middle man would charge you and did I mention that the transaction is near instant?  

Gold and Bitcoin have a very liquid market where fiat money can be exchanged for them or the other way around. Of course, Bitcoin is a bit faster than gold but it goes to show that gold still has a place in our society until it just doesn't. As long as gold is being used to value the market and as long as there are people who we yet have to convince that crypto is the future of finance, gold will still be used and just like bitcoin, increase in value over time thanks to its scarcity. 

It is a good idea to have a well balanced portfolio while the cryptospace is still an uncertain place. Not to mention that crypto still suffers from high volatility compared to precious metals. Either way, gold will most likely not be gone from the picture in our lifetime but so wont crypto, even after a few decades bitcoin/the cryptospace will still have more room to grow.",Why Bitcoin and Gold deserves a spot in your portfolio,1634916985

It includes a comprehensive overview of their solution and the benefit of Cardano EUTXO model VS Ethereum + other global shared state chains

 **2.10 Cardano Blockchain &amp; EUTxO Model Cardano offers 3 major innovations making many of the ambitious goals outlined in this paper achievable, where it was not possible before on global-shared state blockchains:** 

&gt;• Smart contracts are composed of on-chain validators and off-chain code; on-chain validators provide the same level of assurance as any other blockchain model, but at the same time Turing-complete off-chain code, written in Haskell, enables performing complex and resource-consuming computation without any impact on transaction cost; this is revolutionary, as ideas such as programmable swaps and algorithmic  automated market maker (AAMM) would not be possible to implement without it. What’s more, on-chain validators provide full scope of smart contract security, meaning that despite the off-chain code, the entire protocol is equivalent to being fully executed on-chain as all security is achieved on-chain.  
&gt;  
&gt; • EUTxO fragmentation and redeemer model, which provides a unique method to enable many concurrent independent actions to take place in parallel across multiple protocols; for instance, given this fragmentation and desire to arbitrage with other DEXs, this can be done simply thanks to the EUTxO model and how redeemers work.   
&gt;  
&gt;• Hydra head – fast and isomorphic state channels allowing for straightforward usage of the same transaction settlement code in the local hydra head formation, allowing for significant performance improvement without incurring layer 2 software engineering cost.   
&gt;  
&gt;You will be able to stake your ADA wile simultaneously participating in DEFI adding extra yield to the users.

Users will be able to simultaneously interact with smart contracts &amp; participate in proof of stake allowing a double yield ROI from the system. Chains that involve locking of tokens / slashing during POS do not have this benefit as you are either securing the system ***OR*** interacting with SC's.

 **7.2 ADA Staking Rewards from Smart Contracts** 

&gt;The architecture of Cardano’s Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol and EUTxOs means that it is possible to delegate ADA locked into smart contracts to pools in order to earn additional yield. Maladex sees this basically as a riskless return rate r. Any capital that is not actively used or required for a specific action can be delegated and earn staking rewards. Hence, it also provides a nice benchmark for all investments. If any investment is not able to generate the revenue higher than the current Cardano network ROI, then it is not worthy of engagement in, unless it provides hedge against risk. 

**The platform will allow inherent decentralized options trading to the users**

 **12.1 Option Trading Strategies** 

&gt;We further propose composite smart contracts allowing purchase of option trading strategies. A user would select the risk and profit profile, input strategy parameters, and smart contract would automatically structure using the required composites for the strategy. This adds a new innovative way of trading and makes option trading (usually very risky to novice) available in a risk controlled manner (outlying the risk at value, the best/worst potential outcomes, and for savvy trades just allows for easy locking option strategy). We outline below a dozen of option trading strategies that we’d expect to introduce as a follow up to ability to trade options. This list should evolve in the future and additionally welcome new strategy propositions from the community as long as they’re sound and the risk is easy to understand and display  (strategies are outlined after this)

**The protocol will allow Portfolio managers and on-chain hedge funds to develop via the protocol.**

 **18 On-chain Hedge Fund** 

&gt;Maladex’s programmable swaps provide unique mechanism for implementation of on-chain hedge fund (first of its kind). Hedge fund is a pooled investment, taking advantage of sophisticated trading strategies and risk management techniques, in attempt to improve performance above the index benchmark. 

**18.1 On-Chain Portfolio Managers**

&gt; Maladex will create a market for trading strategies by enabling of publication of one’s programmable swaps and setting performance based fee, for instance 1% of all revenue generated using the strategy. PMs are going to be incentivized to create and publish trading strategies because of the performance based fee they are going to be able to earn, and platform users will be incentivized to lock funds into strategy vaults by being able to see strategies’ historical performance and PM’s ranking\[24, 27\]. All strategies will be vetted by Maladex security and quant team to ensure only high quality and secure strategies are shared with the community. Further, PMs via Maladex platform will have access to sophisticated tools such as highfrequency and quality data feeds, a backtesting platform, and a wide array of financial instruments to implement strategies, from indexes and synthetics to financial derivatives and options strategies.

The reason its notable to crypto is due to his interest in staking a part of the metaverse, the virtual realm where things have real world ownership, like NFTs and virtual currencies.  

But I digress: Scammers know this, and they are ready to separate fools from their money by posing as whatever the new thing is.  Heres the scams I see every time big tech news happens that you should be aware of: 

1. The Youtube Livestream

You will see videos of Zuckerberg talking about the rebrand and crypto, and there will be a link to send money to this for a 2x return or an airdrop.  You may also see a way to sign up for a free small amount.  Never click on such things, all scams. In some cases they go as far as deepfaking videos!

2. The early coin listing

Just because the ticket symbol is the same doesnt mean its the same coin. You can mint similar initials on different chains if you are fast enough, and they will. Prepare to see these pop up on uniswap, pancakeswap, etc.  Use a search engine to find the real one. Fake IDO pages are also common, so dont click on anything that isnt on the official domain -- and even then, be careful with fan/group pages spoofing to look official

3. The legit press release

The most dangerous scams are the ones that fool journalists. Some clever hackers have done this in the oast where they buy expensive PR blasts to send a truthful sounding release that gets picked up by major websites before the scam is discovered. 

As the old saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.","PSA: Facebook is about to rename itself, here are the 3 scams to avoid",1634827276

Would you like to make some serious cash and help manipulate the market? Today a new coin was launched and it’s called “LAZIO”. Lazio is a fan token of the soccer/football team ss lazio. Weird name if you asked me, but the potential is crazy good. The project has a maximum total supply of 40,000,000 and currently there are 8,600,000 coins in circulation.  This means that with team work we can easily pump this bad boy up and gain some really good profits. The ICO price was only a dollar and it skyrocketed to a hundred really quick, then dropped to the 20-ish range.

Let’s get this back to 50, 60, or even a hundred! You can purchase this on Binance.

408,CryptoCurrency,longboardsilver,"I've been in the crypto world for a couple of months only. I've been learning my first steps, made my first mistakes, traded too many coins, learned what FOMO meant after I went FOMO... Lists goes on...

But I want to share one thing with other newbies that are trying thise crazy world for the first time.

Instead of trying to gather as much information as possible on YouTube, Reddit, Telegram and such, try learning by trial and error first.

The internet can be overwhelming with information, and first time mistakes can be very costly. But if you do a small investment to educate yourself before you put down bags of money into it, you will be better prepared.

I invested 150.00 first hand, knowing I would probably lose it. I treated those 150 like if it was 150,000. Caring for every cent.

Those first 150.00 allowed me to learn the ropes, gas fees, transfers to wallets, different blockchains. I cried when I hit bottom with a shit coin, even tho it was only 20.00, and jumped around when I lived my first 30% pump.

In the end, I lost maybe 30% of my initial investment over 2 months,  mostly on gas fees. So I took a crash course of crypto for about 50.00 bucks, before deciding if crypto was for me. 

It is like renting a car and flooring it hard before buying the real deal, instead of flooring and crashing your brand new car.

Now, I'm no expert and I can't give any financial advice. But investing a small amount to learn how to read charts, touch all the buttons, test different exchanges (cex and defi) will give you a good idea about potential gains and losses before you go all in.

I see everywhere ""do not invest more than you can afford to lose"" and it is a 100% true. But preparing yourself mentally by trading with a small amount and treating like a lot more money will give you the experience to truly understand what it means.

414,CryptoCurrency,jgarcya,"Things people look at for decision whether to invest in a coin...

Is it useful? Supply? Market cap? Age of project? Speed of transactions? Costs of transactions?

USEFULNESS

Is doge useful? Yes.. It is accepted by 1000's of retailers... It is accepted by major League teams... It is a coin.

Is shiba useful? Other than swapping it, or staking it, for bone and leash, and the creation of shitty nft... It is basically useless.

SUPPLY

Doge... Roughly 300 billion with a cap of 5 billion added annually..... It is deflationary in relation to supply...

Shiba inu.... 1 quadrillion tokens( claimed half burned) with a current supply of 395 Trillion...

For doge to add 1 Trillion coins it would take 200 years...

MARKET CAP

Doge... Between 31-33 billion.... Roughly 8yrs old.

Shiba inu ... 12 billion...just over 1 yr old.

Doge.... has 4.4 million addresses

Shiba .... Has 760,000 addresses

SPEED of transactions

Both doge n shiba have fast transactions.... Doge is currently being worked on for cheaper n faster transactions.

Doge... 1 minute transactions... Btc has 10 minute blocks/transactions.

Shiba inu.... Erc- 20 token... Has fast transactions.

COST OF TRANSACTIONS

Doge...2.35 doge per transaction... But developers are working on making it faster.

Shiba inu... Since it is an erc-20 token..... Fees are RIDICULOUS.. Could cost $20-30 per transaction.

CONCLUSION...

Dogecoin beats shiba on every level, except speed..

But currently doge is under development... Fees and speed are being increased...

Also an wth/doge bridge is being created... Which means anything that can be done on the ethereum chain..... Will be possible with doge/eth.

So as far as one coin vs the other... My $ is on doge.

417,CryptoCurrency,cidadefalcao,"**THIS IS NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY THE FUTURES ETFs. THIS IS JUST A LIST OF REASONS OF WHY BITCOIN PRICE CAN ULTIMATELY BENEFIT FROM HAVING THEM COMPARED TO NOT HAVING THEM AROUND. IF YOU CAN BUY SPOT BTC AND WANT BTC EXPOSURE, BUY SPOT BTC**

We have seen in the last few weeks a lot of bashing on the recently approved ETFs (so far, ProShares, which has been launched, plus Valkyrie and VanEck, which will launch tomorrow and next week respectively). I do not disagree with any of the arguments around (apart from occasional ""duh they gonna suppress price through paper BTC"" argument, which is simply wrong - I explain that in my first point in the following). Now I proceed to list a few GOOD things about a futures ETF in comparison to a spot ETF, mostly because I've seen no one mentioning those so far. Again I stress that **I agree with the arguments for why spot &gt; futures**. **No need to repeat them and say that futures is shit and spot is good because I agree with that.** I am just presenting a silver lining here given what we have in the markets now.

I) The Futures ETF, by not requiring the ETF issuer to hold bitcoin but just future contracts from a particular exchange, is **more easily auditable**. The daily open interest on bitcoin futures at the CME can be checked at [https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin.volume.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin.volume.html), making it very difficult for the ETF issuer to increase the ETF shares supply without going long on the futures contract. With a spot ETF, you need to trust the issuer (or the custodian) holds the bitcoins because they very likely will not reveal the address where the bitcoins are (for either security reasons or regulation reasons, or both).

II) With the Futures ETF, there is **ZERO risk the coins can be stolen, confiscated, or lost**, because they hold no coins. By holding a contract that provides exposure to the underlying, the ""carrying risk"" is held by those buying spot and shorting futures to capture the premium. One of the main sources of this premium (in addition to the time value of money), which is not small and is the main disadvantage of the futures ETF) is precisely having to manage the security by your own.

III) With the Futures ETF, you can **benefit in the short term by a rapid increase in BTC prices**. While a spot bitcoin ETF would ideally perfectly track the bitcoin price, the Futures ETF track future contracts. The futures premium over spot can increase over short time periods, providing a higher return than simply holding bitcoin spot.

IV) With the bitcoin futures ETF, you can **benefit from shifts in interest rates**, should them ever occur. If the interest rates go down, the new future contract will trade at a lower price than they would otherwise. When rolling them, the ""contango bleed"" (the loss by selling a close to spot futures to buy an above spot futures expiring at a later date) will be reduced. If the interest rates go up, those holding the ETF will instantly benefit as the futures premium increase. Over time though, they will lose as the contango bleed increases. Admittedly, this is a very limited benefit because it goes away over time.

V) **If there is a big crash, you can benefit from an ""inverse contango bleed""/carrying premium** as futures may trade at a lower price than spot. For those holding the ETF through the crash event though, their losses can be magnified (although not necessarily: the futures price might decrease less than the spot price). This is not necessarily an advantage as it has a good and bad side but, with the futures ETF you have the possibility to have, at some point, a carrying premium. With a spot bitcoin ETF, this cannot happen.

VI) **Many institutional investors are restricted from taking positions in foreign-traded ETFs either by regulation or by mandate, so the futures ETF is all they have**. Same for some individuals. Again, not exactly an advantage over spot, but an advantage over nothing nevertheless. An hypothetical advantage over spot in that regard is that some institutional investors might be restrained from investing in some ""riskier"" ETFs, which in terms of security as explained in I) might be the case of the spot ETF but not the futures ETF. I admit however that this is a very speculative reasoning.

VII) Due to the return on the cash holdings (a futures ETF typically holds cash/treasuries and go long on future contracts), **a futures ETF might offer a lower effective total expense ratio/management fee than the spot ETF** (particularly if interest rates rise one day). Even if they do not rise though, a small return will be earned in the cash, which is not the case of the spot ETF. Additionally, due to competition with spot ETFs in the future, the futures ETF issuers might be able to reduce their fees even further, capturing some market share from spot ETF issuers and benefiting investors.",Seven GOOD things about the bitcoin Futures-Based ETF,1634828027

Highlights:

* ""The “risk-based” regime is broken, suggests the study. The authors found that the varying risk profiles made “almost no difference” to banks’ willingness to open an account; CSPS (lawyers, etc) were even less sensitive to risk.""
* ""The study shows that the grunt-work of aml is being “pushed onto a private sector which can’t or won’t do it,” says Mr Sharman. “Banks are unable or unwilling to make the fine-grained risk judgments the system demands, because they use standardised, generic procedures.”""

For example, SILENTDATA enables smart contract applications to verify a user’s bank balance, income, or even a business invoice without the data being revealed to anyone in the process

SILENTDATA will enable verification of private, offchain data on Algorand and therefore help to accelerate Future of Finance (FutureFi), the convergence of traditional and decentralized models into a unified system, on the Algorand blockchain

London, October 20th, 2021 - The Algorand Foundation announced today that it has awarded software-development company Applied Blockchain a grant for the integration of its award-winning SILENTDATA platform with the Algorand blockchain, enabling users to present privacy-preserving proof of their traditional financial activity.

SILENTDATA, developed by Applied Blockchain, enables private off-chain data to be verified on-chain without revealing the underlying private data to anyone. Initially focussed on Open Banking data, the Algorand Foundation grant will support SILENTDATA in enabling businesses to create privacy-preserving NFTs of their invoices, and present these to a liquidity pool on the Algorand blockchain.

The integration of SILENTDATA on the Algorand blockchain marks a significant step forward in the Future of Finance (FutureFi), the convergence of traditional banking and decentralized models into a unified system. It will enable more efficient and open forms of lending, where verification of sensitive off-chain data while maintaining full data privacy of the party concerned plays a critical part.

Adi Ben-Ari, Founder and CEO of Applied Blockchain, added: “Our team has been building applications on the Algorand blockchain for almost two years, including a world-class, fully-integrated NFT marketplace, a comprehensive project launchpad, and many more. Algorand has an amazing team, a very active and growing community, and a world class blockchain, and we look forward to bringing SILENTDATA to this ecosystem to be part of FutureFi.”

In August, SILENTDATA won the award in the category for “Best Digital Identity Solution” at the Open Banking Expo Awards 2021.

Addie Wagenknecht, Head of Global Ecosystems at the Algorand Foundation, added “Applied Blockchain has been a particularly active partner in the Algorand ecosystem, and we are very excited to see the potential for SILENTDATA in enabling convergence of traditional and decentralised models of finance.”

For example, Reddit is my primary news source for niches. 

And around the end of Sept/start of Oct, Bitcoin started climbing, and hasn't seemed to stop.

If something big happened that got people sprung for Bitcoin, why isn't that reflected in these subs? There's nothing major in /r/bitcoin for around that time period. So what got the ball rolling?

I also keep hearing that a handful of people control a lot of the crypto. Could it be that a handful of whales are strategically buying and selling, simply because they know that people watch those charts like hawks?

I realize it could be a myriad of factors but whatever is causing those prices to suddenly go up isn't even a blip on Reddit's radar. To me, that doesn't add up.",Question: what is making coins jump in price all of a sudden?,1634741460
527,CryptoCurrency,TrueSpins,"I have been in crypto since early 2013, and from the outset I fell in love with the idea. As a result, I spoke very openly about my love of crypto to anyone that would listen, including colleagues, friends, friends of friends, barmen... whoever. 

As the years went on, my initial modest investment became quite serious money, and shortly after Bitcoin hit 20k in 2017, I started to get random messages from people I hardly knew, asking whether I was still into Bitcoin. The same happened back in April when it was around $60k. This was the first time I got a bit nervous, as a friend of someone I hardly know contacted me - I didn't respond.

Technically speaking, I have sold a lot of my crypto over the years, so I'm not some sort of mega whale. But I do still own a not insignificant sum of crypto. I'm very careful with storage - come around my house and you won't find any hardware wallets or keys - it's all stored in other locations.

But with Bitcoin likely to be hitting the news cycles again, I'm reminded that there are lots of people (hopefully nice people) that know I'm pretty into this stuff, and that worries me a little. Luckily I live in a nice and relatively safe country, so I suspect the risk is somewhat low. But... there's always that worry.

So, I guess the moral of the story is... even if right now you don't own too much crypto, be careful about how much you reveal.","Nowadays, it's obvious that it's not wise to talk about your crypto holdings. But back in 2013 it seemed less dangerous, and now it's catching up with me!",1634741587

A very popular Youtube channel ""BitBoy Crypto"" is definitely one of the biggest channels about Crypto on YouTube. And that is really unfortunate. He has many videos about Crypto which look pretty ok but don't get deceived by looks. This channel is one major Pump it and Dump it source.

Remember the Phantasma video he uploaded? Thst was the first thing I noticed.

Market cap of Phantasma coin literally 2x-ed during 24 hours before BitBoy released his youtube video. It went from about 30 mil to over 80! The price of token doubled in a matter of hours. Once the video was released the Phantasma started to dump hard and losing all profit it generated before in matter of hours.

His meltdown on Twitter a couple months ago after losing a poll to Guy from CoinBureau will show you his true character.

There are also rumors (?)  that (quoting)

&gt; he also bribes to shill shitcoins; the current rate is anywhere between 15 and 25 thousand dollars. So when he comes up with his next suggestion to buy and watch moon, realize that he was paid to pump it. 

Now BitBoy is starting to FUD on BTC and ETH.

Don't panic though, there is a lot more to gain here than gains.

1. Why are my (non BTC) coins dumping?
People are chasing candles. Don't worry, the money will flow through the major alts down to minor ones and small caps. Just don't be afraid to take profits.

2. Surviving the FOMO.
If you see BTC or an alt pumping madly, try not to paper hands your other coins and try catch it. This will most likely result in pain. If you've done a good bit of reading about crypto, you will know diversification is a thing but sticking to it can be hard. HODL strong.

3. Know when to pull out.
Have a target (be realistic) for taking profit. Stick to it and be happy. I am tempted to say never completely sell out if that's an option, keep a little of the ones you truly believe in.

4. Learn.
If you survive it all and fancy doing it again, remember how it went last time. See what worked out, what didn't. Have a look at how your portfolio does as the moneys flows and remember, this won't be the last time.

554,CryptoCurrency,Iv3llios,"This is an opinion piece, and is written following experiencing a real sense of alarm at the sight of the latest development with Facebook. I attempt here to express my concern, and present the few solutions available right now thanks to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. If I made any mistake please feel free to correct me. 

Facebook is currently at a truly pivoting point in its existence. It finds itself facing a multitude of major events simultaneously, all with the potential to drastically influence it's position and role in the future.

## From the Metaverse to cryptocurrency, Facebook's vision is broadening

First is the very purpose of the company itself, and its' mission. Facebook started off as a social media company. Its founder's ability to envision the role social media could play in the future made it one of the most successful company the like of which the world has rarely seen. Combining that with its aggressive tendency to acquire most successful social networks has enabled it to achieve a truly dominant position in the social media space.

Yet given all of the above, Facebook is only truly getting started.

Credit given to where credit is due, the company's ability to envision the future has yet again proven correct, and the acquisition of Oculus lab enabled Facebook to broaden it's horizon to something I find truly terrifying. Facebook is now going after achieving a position in the Metaverse market similar to the one it currently enjoys in the social media. The move isn't too outlandish, as social medias themselves are a sort of v1 form of metaverses, making it natural for Facebook to continue in this direction.

*Among notable events related to that, Facebook has recently announced it would hire an extra 10 000 staff to work on constructing their vision of the metaverse, and intend on rebranding itself to reflect this new direction.*

Another majorly troubling development is the effort Facebook has been putting in carving itself a position on the cryptocurrency sphere, initially with the creation of Libra, eventually abandoned following significant backlash to adopt (a.k.a. effectively rebrand to) Diem. Facebook's Novi wallet is one of the latest development on that regard, and aims at being implemented and accessible across Facebook services (whatsapp, instagram, facebook messenger) in the near future. This furthermore tie in very well with the Metaverse efforts mentioned earlier, as after all, every space needs a form of currency. 

This dominant position in the communication space is placing Facebook in a position of strength, and enables it to push itself to dominate more and more of the online ""world"" with every new technology being integrated in its ecosystem.

## Facebook truly cares; just not about you

The latest efforts of whistle-blowers to lift the veil on Facebook's actions unfortunately yet again only confirmed what was already known and suspected. 

As of now, and to put it bluntly, Facebook is a threat to society. 

To best understand this statement, please take the time to watch this interview if you haven't had the chance yet [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_Lx5VmAdZSI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lx5VmAdZSI)

Despite being fully aware of its impact, Facebook has not only decided to continue on their course of action, and further increase their efforts in expanding their role and importance in the world. Its impact is already visible world-wide, and I can only shiver at the though of them dominating what might be one day the main online metaverse along with it's main currency.

## Blockchain and cryptocurrencies: a solution?

Yes, or at least partially.

While Facebook is currently in a position of force, the battle for achieving internet freedom isn't lost yet. Social media, the metaverse, online video games, all of those share one primary feature. They are dependent on the network effect (a.k.a. only valuable/successful if used by a significant enough number of people). An empty metaverse, and unused currency, no matter how good, will simply not succeed, as their true value lie in the communities present or using them.

A number of alternative are seeing the light of day as we speak. Decentraland for example gives us a glimpse of what a truly free metaverse could look like, and all cryptocurrencies and crypto-projects out there can prove to be good if not better alternatives to Facebook Diem.

While there is little we can do to prevent Facebook from continuing in its quest for control, we can all as a community at least attempt to steer society's ship in a different direction through controlling our usage of its services. (sorry for the bad metaphor)

To call back a familiar moto, ""we are early"", so please if you share the same concerns, actively stay away from their services, and avoid feeding the beast as much as possible.

Maybe you're like me and your ""plan"" is to just be in crypto for the long run because you were too lazy to make any other plan. Then stick to that, enjoy the ride and the green charts but don't deviate from that long-term goal.

Maybe you want to take some profits and buy back in later. Don't try to time it, if your gains are sufficient enough for you, start DCA'ing out. If you keep waiting for prices to rise to squeeze out an extra couple of percent, there's no gain that will ever be sufficient enough for you.

Maybe you're some crazy mf who has been DCAing in this entire time despite raising your cost basis, then by all means, keep going and godspeed to you.

Whatever your situation is, please be sensible. We all like to joke about FOMO'ing back in now that we're at an ATH but no one knows what will happen next and if you're not careful, you may do something you'll regret.

Start here with his first one made in late 2018(Dec?).

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWdOztDkv4

In this video.... Bob predicted the bottom of the bitcoin 4 yr cycle, almost to the day.... Remarkable!

I discovered this video in early 2019.... Started buying btc, ltc, eth...with every available dollar I had in March 2019.

I was homeless, but employed, but made just enough to cover bills( not rent)... Long story.

So at the time I could only throw $20/$40 a week at the ATM.... Thank you coinflip ATM.

And over the course of this period of time... My little bits of money put into crypto grew, and grew... Faster than I could keep up with it... Crypto took off so fast, I couldn't meet my crypto goals...

But I didn't give up... I kept DCA, whenever btc dropped 5-10%/30%/50%... Still haven't reached my goals in crypto...

Picked up doge in 2020 at .003.... Knowing it was going to jump someday.

But I had faith in the 4 yr cycle... Kept pushing through... Knowing that 2021 was the year of the bull run... And we saw 64k btc... 4k eth... 200+ltc... .64 doge...

I'm not homeless today, but am living with my mom now, after my dad passed away I moved back.

I've been hodlin ever since my start... Sold some doge thru r.h. for a quick grand, but that's it.

So here we are today.... The 4yr cycle is right on point... We are seeing new ATH, in the last quarter, and it's only Oct...

The last 4yr cycle peaked Dec. 17th(ish) 2017..... I expect this cycle to do the same, or possibly lengthen.

Here is the latest video between Bob loukas and Benjamin cowen discussing the possibility of the lengthening of the 4 yr cycle...

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RJcXNqyc_3k

Will it lengthen? Who knows?

If you hodl, it doesn't matter....

If you DCA, it may matter, so you can time your buys a bit, and try not to buy at all time highs...

If you trade, or wanna sell the top, and buy the bottom... These videos are a must watch!

I'm not sure how I'm planning my strategy... I'll figure that out in Dec... Or early 2022(if it lengthens)..

But I will say.... It is because of Bob loukas, and his awesome work he does on his videos.... It allowed me to stay focused, not sweat the dips, and have faith in the cycle...

And bc of this.... I have a 5 yr plan... And can actually see myself possibly retiring at 54...

From homeless to retirement in less than 10yrs would be incredible!

If I buy into the ETF does my holdings include SATs/BTC or not?

Is the price of the ETF linked to the price of Bitcoin or is it it's own financial instrument with its own price? 

If the latter, are Bitcoin/crypto ETFs just another traditional financial tool for hedge funds/banks to use to pump their gains and manipulate the market?

* 1INCH (INCH) +22%
* OKB (OKB) +19%

These tokens tend to run through significant up/down cycles, sometimes in line with general Bitcoin trends, but often enough to have short runs outside of the mainstream (\*e.g. DyDx doubled in the last two weeks of Sept.)

So let's just put it this way:

I'm a fan of cold storage. I prefer a ledger over an exchange or a hot wallet. 

Is there a way to keep my coins on the ledger and also stake them on other platforms, validators,  etc. 

Any risks, pros or cons?

I only got into crypto in September so I missed the fun this round. I only made around 5% return lol. Yay me. 

I am good with stocks and other financial products since I studied and work in the industry, but crypto is new to me. 

Current allocation at:

BTC 31.78%
ETH 28.30%
ALGO 14.29%
ATOM 7.28%
SOL 6.13%
ADA 3.87%
AVAX 3.43
MATIC 1.59%
LINK 1.59%
VET 1.59%
XLM 0.16% (I tend to use it for purchasing and swaping)

Wondering if there is anything I'm missing when it comes to staking or governance really. I missed the ALGO Oct 14 round btw. I was so obsessed over lowering gas fees and transaction costs that I just missed it. 

I made little return also because I bought at higher points due to well...starting in September. And I also include all my gas fees and trading expenses in the mix. 

When it comes to staking, now I'm staking ALGO, ATOM, SOL, ADA, AVAX, VET. 

But as an example, while I love the binance APY, their withdrawal fees hurt my soul, depending on coin. 

So in the end it takes quite the time to just make the withdrawal fees equivalent from staking before anything. So it's quite an opportunity cost there.

It took too long for me to learn about how gas fees are handled so I lost quite a bit of cash from my returns. But I learned a lot. 

I feel like I'm hitting a wall and don't know where to look. 

Any insights? What would you do with such an allocation? Stake? Where and how?

So there's this app called Fenix360. The people who created this app also created a crypto for it. 

The money suits behind this project are Broadway producers, musicians, Hollywood professionals, and executives that used to work for record labels. 

What it does? Takes out Middlemen of the entertainment industry. So record labels and distributors. 

Why? 
- Cause record labels take most of the money for themselves and artists get a very small cut. 
- AD monetization is mostly taken by the middle man (YouTube, Instagram, FB, etc..) 
- Only 2 percent of the world's artists and creators can actually earn a living from what they do. The rest is undiscovered talent and people without the privilege of having opportunities to succeed with their art. 

What Fenix360 is doing? 
- Giving power back to the artists by providing an all in one app so that any musician, actor, painter, designer, dancers, and more, can have all of their content like songs, videos, Products, merch, NFTs, events, and updates in a way that's never been done before. 

How? Through Fenix360 you can make your own app. For your content and your content only. 

By having your own app, brands and products will come to you instead of Instagram/FB/YouTube in order to advertise. Why? Because this app is made to build loyal followers. And corporations will pay more money for loyal 1000 followers than possibly thousands of inactive followers buried with in the 100k range or more. 

Loyal followers means a better chance for them to be loyal customers of (Insert product name here). 

So how does that help? 
- 95 percent of ad revenue goes to content creator. 
- 100 percent of merch, ticket sales, and NFTs goes to artists 
- NO GAS FEES on NFTs (it's included in buying price instead) 
- no more record labels ripping off musicians. (They can now sell their music and keep the majority of the money)
- option to monetize live streaming 


The community for this is growing by hundreds every day. The app just launched last week and the developers are working hard to get this in front of the people. 

This app running on Blockchain can allow an artist to literally wake up, make art, post about it on this app, then go to sleep. Just like that they made money just by having people watch their content. You don't need thousands of followers to make a living which is why this is so cool. It opens the door to creators who don't have a big following and it gives them the opportunity to earn just the same.

After mulling over comments which surfaced recently which pointed out correctly that the market capitalisation of your crypto is not a measure of how much money has entered or bought into it, rather just the multiplication of current price with total number of coins.

Given that different coins seem to have different ""liquidity"" that is, the measure by which the buying/selling can affect the price, then, could it be said that some coins' market cap could theoretically be higher than the total money invested (for low liquidity where there is a lot of buying) versus the situation where a coin with high liquidity might not possibly see a big rise despite a lot of buying and large influx of funds.

If I'm wrong partially, I do accept that I might not have the full grasp of how the mechanics of liquidity and market capitalisation work, but I'm happy to be educated.

Which leads me to the following; why when predicting the performance of (say) BTC, the likes of Wood, Saylor et. al. seem to repeat themselves by stating that;

""BTC future market cap = current market cap + money about to enter from another financial sphere""

In the case of the above, I've heard plenty of times things like ""if 10Tn dollars comes in from bonds/stocks market, then market cap will be 10x todays' and 10x price per coin.

I believe this to be not quite true. But I have no idea by how much... Ultimately, I'd love to better understand whether we could possibly see the situation where massive influx of money didn't manage to raise the actual price by much, perhaps if it comes in over a long time frame?..",Price of your coin/token more affected by market liquidity than you'd think?,1634657288
690,CryptoCurrency,carlos_fandangos,"Just wanted to drop this article on here, I recommend any crypto investors keep themselves up to date on latest security trends and active exploits in the wild.

I have no comments on coinbase and don't believe the takeaway story here should be anything related to the company per se, rather we should be taking away the message - be careful and vigilant when it comes to receiving emails and texts, no matter how genuine they appear on first glance.

Have a look at the domain in question here and read up on how  **coinbase.com.password-reset\[.\]com** is something that should raise a red flag.  Anything directly next to the last .com is the real  domain, anything preceding this with periods/full stops is a sub domain.  

&amp;#x200B;

I could easily go and register a domain name for $10 (ie. 123789abczxy\[dot\]com) and then use any subdomain/s I want with this.  I could do kraken.com.123789abczxy\[dot\]com and this would be legit.

The craftiness is in their selection of the domain they use, here mine is obviously suspicious, but if I could secure id-verify\[dot\]com it could suddenly look quite real....  coinbase.id-verify\[dot\]com

Just be vigilant and try to keep yourself clued up on security trends.  As I say most of you are very smart and do lots of research on the incredible technology behind crypto, lets all spend an extra 10 mins a week or so just checking out the latest news in the security world.

What if you could roll the time back 5 years and you had the knowledge you had now? BTC was around $500-800, you weren't in a position to yolo it and buy like a million BTC's for some spare change. Things were starting to heat up. Would you have held up untill now or would have sold when it went 5x?  
Now imagine 10 years ago, would you have held for 10 years, considering the amount of uncertainty in the crypto market back than? What if you had the conviction you have now?  


For me, I had heard about Bitcoin back in 2013 but I just didn't imagine it being something real, at that point in time it felt more like a pyramid type of scheme. Even If I would have invested back than I am 100% sure I would have taken my money out when it went 2-3x and bought myself something nice, so now I dont really have any regrets for not investing in it earlier.  
I would advice myself to do so and hold, but again, we all know I would've sold anyway. 

Most importantly, what mistakes did you do on your crypto journey so far that you would advice yourself not to do if you had the chance?  
Let's educate some of the newer ones here!","Imagine its 2016, what advice would you give yourself with the knowledge you have now?",1634568259
705,CryptoCurrency,heyitsmetheguy,"- Most people here have no idea what they are talking about. (including me) 

- Most people here don't have enough experience with crypto to even give their advice a second thought. I'd bet 90% of people have been in crypto less than 2 years.

- Most of the people I talk to about crypto still are not willing to invest large sums of money into crypto. I know people with over 10k in crypto, while I'd bet most people on here have less than 1-2k. (including you reading this)

- No one actually has to lose money for crypto to go up. (but people selling/rebuying will cause you to lose money) 

- Most people here have lost money/ are breaking even from the last two ATHs

- Your favorite coin will probably be a shit coin in less than 4 years. Unless it's actually being used for its intended use case. (dosent mean you should sell now, but it can't hurt to set up automatic profit taking points)

- If you take profit you most likely will lose out on making more, but you should still do it. (I've taken some profit right after every ATH and reinvest during the dips) **dips being a price lower than you bought in for, sometimes only by 10%**

- Stop giving advice to people when you haven't made money. No one wants that advice. 

- If everyone is telling you that X coin is a shit coin then it probably is, but dosent mean you can't invest in it. 

- Most of you are not well off and will never be just because of crypto. You can be if you invest smart/DCA and the biggest hurdle for you will be : picking a good coin. (This is the hardest part because actually good coins aren't moving because people can't pump them, and can't get their gullible followers to buy in. If a coin looks like safe moon or Shiba inu it's easy for people to get dumbies to buy in and hold with ""diamond hands"". You should only hold like that on good coins, those will most likely not be mentioned on YouTube or ads.)

721,CryptoCurrency,Wonderful_Bad6531," PRICE (X supply) DICTATES THE MARKET CAP, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND Market cap is the sum of the last price an asset was traded for multiplied by the total supply For every buyer, there has to be at least one seller and the transaction is for part of the circulating supply. Therefore, we place our buy orders and sell orders in relation to the price of one individual coin/token. Prices drive the market, market capitalization is a byproduct that has little to do with the actual amount of money invested.

example Bitcoin has a circulating supply of 19,000,000 coins and at $30,000 per coin it would have a market cap of $570 billion.

When demand is high and buying pressure far exceeds selling pressure, market cap can and will rise by multiples of the amount of money actually invested.

If Bitcoin, with a circulating supply of 19,000,000, gets traded at $30,000 then seconds later, in a frenzy of cancelled and resubmitted buy and sell orders, a trade executes at $30,100 that would cause the market cap to increase from $570 billion to $571.9 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion dollars but it could have been just 1 trade at $30,100 for 1 Bitcoin. Far less money entered the market between $30,000 and $30,100 than $1.9 billion.

Market cap is not equal to money invested or even true value. It’s just a reflection of the last agreed upon price multiplied by supply. It’s misleading when crypto market caps are compared to market caps of traditional assets

\_\_

PRICE AND PRICE MOVEMENTS ARE REFLECTIONS OF SENTIMENT AND OPINION, NOT ACTUAL VALUE The market price of any asset is the price of the last transaction between a buyer and a seller. On their own, inflation, deflation, the amount of coins staked, upgrades, scientific methods, superior tech, hard forks, a tweet from the man that wants to be the “I’m not like the other girls” of billionaires, FUD or anything else doesn’t affect price. Our feelings about these things are translated into the only actions that affect price, buying and selling.

Price, like market cap, has little to do with the amount of money flowing in or out of an asset. The flow of feelings, FUD and FOMO, if translated into exaggerated buy orders and sell orders can swing prices dramatically.

Let’s say Ethereum has a current market price of $2,000 and we can look at the order book and see sellers have put sell orders, (ask price) in for 1 full Eth at $2,100 and for every one hundred dollar interval up to $3000. There will also be buy orders (bid price) placed. bUy ThE diP The first buy order is 1 Eth at $2000 and 1 Eth for every one hundred dollar interval all the way down to $1600.

I want to buy one full Eth. I can make a market order, which in most cases doesn’t actually change the price, or I can place a buy order for 1 Eth at $2,100 and get matched up with the guy or lady that has a sell order at $2,100. The market value for Ethereum is now $2,100

NOTE: there would probably be transactions in between this on a *normal day for fractional amounts of Ethereum. I mathed easier numbers here as I did with the market cap example. You get the idea though*

What if it’s not a NORMAL day and emotions run high? fictional fud All over Reddit and Twitter the news breaks that EIP-1559 will be delayed until mid 2022. Emotions and GWEI run high.

The highest sell orders, $3000 $2900 and $2800 get canceled because they know the moon shot is moon dust now and the buy orders that were just below the market price, $2000 $1900 and $1800 get canceled because the buyers think this news may cause a larger drop in price. There have been no sells yet, just canceled orders. The $1700 guy decides he doesn’t want to catch the falling knife after all and cancels.

The buyer that placed his buy order at $1600 was prepared for this and the seller that had the sell order at $2200 isn’t a HODLer and thinks the delay may keep the price down for a long time and he wants out now so he enters a sell order at $1600. The price of Ethereum is now $1600

The cancellation and/or addition of buy orders and sell orders in a short time frame by enough people can dramatically affect price. It doesn’t take a “whale” buying a large amount. This is how price can fall or rise rapidly when sentiment suddenly changes. Buyers expect a lower price and cancel orders. Sellers become less hopeful and enter sell orders for lower prices.

Ethereum is still the tried and true Ethereum, nothing happened but news and a sentiment shift. It’s value is the value we assign it based on opinion.

 Important point to consider. We don’t really know the value of crypto. There’s not enough utility and use. There are no balance sheets and sales reports. It derives it’s value from it’s popularity. Think of a coin in the top 5 that’s only real use case right now is staking. We value it higher than almost every other crypto for what it might do. Supply and demand is murky water in crypto as well. Most of the demand is us wanting to buy it and hope the price goes up or hope that it’s used one day. 

TLDR1: In crypto, the only use for market cap is measuring risk vs reward against Bitcoin. Price determines market cap and buy orders and sell orders based on opinion determine price. Technically, Enough people can drive any shitcoin to any price or market cap.

TLDR2:  Easiest way to think about it:

You create your own token with a supply of 1,000,000 and sell a token to your friend to $1.This means a market cap of $1,000,000 and you own 999,999 tokens. But you’re nowhere near being a millionaire because your tokens have a distinct lack of liquidity. The value of your token is not equal to its market cap.",Market cap,1634568815

Want to see the metrics of your favorite coins on your (apple) watch at all times? Me too!! So I looked it up for you all, follow my steps below.

Step 1: download Crypto Pro app, tap on the Apple Watch app and scroll down to “Available to install” section and tap on Crypto Pro.

Step 2: Within the Crypto Pro app, make sure it displays the market coins as your favorites, and adjust which coins you like most. The top 4 are most important!

Step 3: Configure your Apple Watch complication settings (via Apple Watch app). For mine I added my top three coins as Large complication, and my fourth favorite coin as Small complication!

Step 4: You can configure some additional settings via the Crypto Pro app for refresh times and whatnot.

729,CryptoCurrency,mciv2424,"I'm not going to lie, I have FOMO invested into a few projects. However if you at least DCA FOMO into a project at least that gives you the time to catch good prices and continue to come off your emotional high to decide if you really want to still be in. 

For example, let's say you are FOMO-ing into SHIB (I picked SHIB because if you are still reading then you are too smart to FOMO into SHIB). Instead of throwing $1000 into it right now, you should put $200 a week into it for 5 weeks. This accomplishes two things. 1) The reason you are probably FOMO-ing in right now is because the asset is hot and is probably at an ATH or at a peak, so DCA-ing in over the next few weeks will help you catch better prices if the crypto comes back to earth 2) DCA-ing in over a month or two will help you come off of your emotional high and make sure you really like the technology, people behind the project, and the price you are getting in at. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are day trading, then obviously this isn't for you. If you are a crypto investor, hodler, or long term bull then I would highly suggest committing to only doing DCA FOMO purchases when you are tempted to FOMO buy. It will help you in the long run. I have FOMO-ed into some crap projects that lost money and I have FOMO-ed into some great projects that have yielded big returns. But committing to DCA FOMO purchases when I have to scratch that FOMO itch has saved me from some big losses and has lead me to do more research and create bigger bags than I would have of some really great projects (e.g. ALGO).","If you are going to FOMO invest, at least DCA FOMO invest ... trust me.",1634569112

# What is it?

Enjin Coin represents a complex ecosystem, born some years ago and willing to create a safe, fast and designed environment in favor of gamers.  During this bull run, the link between crypto and gaming has been growing a lot, including the NFTs and play-to-earn topics  . Enjin fits into all this, which has decided to focus his business model on the possibility of being able to build game content, virtual resources, NFT exchanges and much more, using a new generation platform, simple to use and dedicated. The development of the Enjin Coin community has represented a crucial pillar and a fundamental point since the launch of the project. Many ecosystems, including decentralized and open source ones present in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector, base much of their essence precisely on the presence of users willing to use the services.  Going into more detail of the project, referring to the initial presentations of Enjin Coin, the project would aim to:

* Improve the creation of video games, making sure that developers can really highlight their ideas and potential, without being forced to design based on the choices of publishers. This would allow a greater freedom and the creation of a gaming sector focused on the real demands of the players.
* Diversified system of obtaining prizes and above all on the skills and on the real preparation of the players. All while maintaining a high level of security, which in the gaming and NFT sector has begun to represent an increasingly important aspect.

# How does it work?

During the introductory paragraphs, we exposed the presence of Enjin Coins within the gaming sector. It is good to keep in mind that since its inception the ecosystem has added numerous features and upgrades, in order to offer complete experiences from all points of view.  So let's see on which pillars the functioning of Enjin Coin is based:

* **Tokenized resources on the Enjin platform:** the first possibility given by the Enjin platform is obviously that of being able to build digital resources, that is Tokenized, through the use of basic blockchain technologies, Smart Contracts and much more. Game tokens can be customized based on your tastes and talents and anyone can participate in their own project.  In fact, the Enjin platform provides a very simplified management of design tools, precisely with the aim of facilitating use not only for professional users, but also for users with their first experiences.  By entering the official page, the platform integrates a real Marketplace. It contains all the virtual instruments offered for sale, obviously expressed not in legal currency, but directly in Enjin Coin.
* **Enjin Wallet:**  the Enjin platform provides a real digital wallet, which can also be conveniently used on your mobile devices. There is no difference between Android devices and iOS devices and anyone has the ability to open their own account quickly and intuitively.  Within the Enjin Wallet, users first and foremost have the ability to keep real cryptographic tools. Within the same portfolio, resulting in the highly specialized Enjin platform and also present in the NFT sector and in other types of tokenization, the Wallet also fully supports instruments belonging to the ERC -721 and ERC -1155 type.  The wallet allows you to exchange resources in a quick and controlled way between network users, simply by addressing and scanning codes
* **Efinity by Enjin:**  the construction of Efinity, although almost completely focused on the world of Non Fungile Tokens, aims to improve some problems related to traditional systems. Specifically, it would aim to:

1. Lower transaction costs
2. Improve interoperability
3. Increase the speed
4. Efficient processes under environmental aspects

Efinity also has its own “EFI” reference token, also in this case listed on the best online operators and intermediaries.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallet for ENJ is Enjin Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. Safe and user friendly wallet
2. Gaming NFTs are a very interesting topic right now
3. Great ecosystem
4. It already has a working product

**Cons**

1. Not much adoption yet
2. No partnerships with well know gaming companies
3. Enjin Wallet is not open source",KnowYourCrypto #36: Enjin Coin (ENJ),1634569301
735,CryptoCurrency,wyzard135,"So in recent news a Bitcoin mining company Stronghold Digital Mining is filing for an IPO at $16-$18 per share. The company is valued at around $1bn. After some research I have come to the conclusion this stock is not worth buying.

Based on what I’ve seen, they have currently a hashrate capacity of 185 petahash per second, and intends to bring its hashrate to over 2100 PH/s by December 2021, and to over 8000 PH/s a year later. This translates to a revenue of $26.7M, $303.1M and $1.15bn respectively at the difficulty level at the time of writing. These figures are expected to fall in the future as bitcoin mining difficulty only goes up. What this means is that in order to keep is in order to keep up with revenue, Stronghold will keep needing to procure miners with the revenue generated, so a large part of the revenue will just go into buying more miners. Not to mention the stock price is subjected to bitcoin's price volatility. 

Apart from mining, Stronghold also owns the power plant that generate electricity for the miners which uses Pennsylvania's waste coal pile. What is waste coal you ask? Basically it's the leftover stuff from coal mining, which are discarded as they don't burn as well as usual coal. What Stronghold is doing is burning these leftover waste coal piles which Pennsylvania has a heap off to generate electricity for bitcoin mining.

Environmentally speaking whether the burning of waste coal is beneficial is controversial, these waste coal pile are harmful as they take up land and messes with the soil and water quality nearby. However burning them is also environmentally harmful, it produces more toxic gases than usual goal, and let's not forget carbon dioxide. Stronghold's mining operation just feeds into the environmental problem bitcoin is facing. I would prefer if Stronghold could use renewables like solar, or at least have a plan to transition to that instead of relying of a finite amount of waste coal, which is inherently unsustainable.

This also means the operations of Stronghold will be subjected very heavily to environmental laws and politics, which add an additional layer of instability.

Another thing is that Stronghold is founded in 2021, meaning it's not even a year old, so we have no idea about the feasibility of Stronghold's business model. Besides having such a young company going public is very rare.

Like to hear what you guys think of Stronghold and if it's a good investment opportunity.

I recently bought some Algorand and started staking on Yieldly (url below) . They are offering 10-11% APY paid out in Yieldly tokens daily. The cool thing about this is you can also then stake your Yieldly in other pools for a 30, 40, and 60% APY. Now, I believe these pools have an expiration date (90~days or so), but they are constantly rolling. There is no minimum amount to stake and you can withdraw at anytime. They also offer a ""No loss"" lottery for everyone who stakes Algo. Winner gets 75% of the pool and the other 25% is distributed amongst the participants. I thought this was a pretty interesting incentive to get people staking.

- He created Ethereum, which is by itself enough to make him a legend

- He launched Ethereum at 20 years old

- He founded Bitcoin Magazine in 2011, making him one of the first to see the potential of cryptos, and he did that at 17 years old

- When he was 6 years old (yes, 6), he made a very complex and detailed encyclopedia about bunnies on Microsoft Excel

- He dropped out of college to work on the Ethereum blockchain (don’t get me wrong, don’t drop out, I’m just saying that man knew how strong was his project)

- He litteraly gave A BILLION DOLLAR in Shiba to help the India to fight the covid-19 pandemy, trolling at the same times all the Shiba holders that gave him this money in order to pump the coin

- He made donations to other charities for a total of more than 400 millions of dollar (in addition to the previous billion)

- Ha has an honorary doctorate at the University of Basel, which is cool for someone who dropped out from school

- He received the Peter Thiel fellowship, I don’t know what it is but it definitely looks cool

- Man is russian-canadian, that’s cool

On the one hand there was Lazio's new shirt sponsor, which all of you will know (i believe they signed a 2 year deal with them).

What i found absolutely incredible about all this is mainly that INTER changed their long-time Pirelli sponsorship (since 1995!) to promote this new Token they've made. I mean, if that isnt proof of just how big the Crypto/NFT world is becoming, i dont know what is! Not only this but i saw Crypto advertisement in many parts of the stadium. So i started searching for which other huge football clubs have been adopting Crypto as their sponsors, and i found that the number is huge. Other clubs like AC Milan, Juventus, Barcelona, Arsenal and Manchester City have their own tokens or agreements with Crytpo-related businesess. This is beautiful news to me (and i think most will agree), because as i mentioned before (and in other posts), clubs are seen as serious millionaire companies/entities, and if they promote Crypto, soon people will think ""Guess it's not just a scam/risky business, if a huge club like Inter has it as its main sponsor"". So yeah, Crypto awareness ftw.

807,CryptoCurrency,jcoll627,"When Bitcoin reached its previous high in April it is clear that high was built on higher leverage than today's Bitcoin price. April's $64K was driven by leverage with the near term goal of reaching a Bitcoin $1,000,000,000,000 (Trillion) market cap for the first time. We then saw a pullback as investors deleveraged to take their gains.

During this recovery phase which has put us over $60K once again, we saw an influx in a higher proportion of actual dollars versus leveraged dollars. 

These are my top reasons why this week's coming Bitcoin all time high is different...
 (1) institutional investors continue to announce investments and plans to invest in Bitcoin (long term holders means more stability, and less / safer leverage)
(2) high amounts of Bitcoin were being purchased and placed in cold storage during the pull back (less supply on market)
(3) recognizable names and companies are increasingly endorsing Bitcoin which further increases the network effect and legitimizes the asset (Tesla, Mr Wonderful, Marc Cuban, Societe General, Fidelity, Twitter, Visa, George Soros, etc)
(4) the US government and the SEC appear to be permitting ETF futures which is a positive signal for a potential physical ETF.

This last point is much more significant than people estimate. If an US ETF is approved it inherently means the US government is limiting its ability to regulate Bitcoin in a negative light. Once retirement savings are legitimatized via ETFs, regulation will come in the form of... How best can the US government protect people's retirements versus pre-ETF approval it feels like the government could still do what it wants. 

Even Mr Wonderful acknowledged that a trillion dollars of ETF money is on the sidelines waiting to enter Bitcoin.

In other words, US ETF approval signifies escape velocity for Bitcoin, both in terms of US government legitimization and stabilization from ETFs capital inflow. We will without a question be above $100,000 Bitcoin if this happens. 

I have Fidelity and I am 38, if that ETF is approved I move my whole retirement (actual retirement from the pharma company I work for) into Bitcoin because I believe the best way to build a better world is to allow programmers to tokenize/digitize the interactions of humanity one interaction at a time.

810,CryptoCurrency,Scary_Milk,"For anyone not familiar with the term altcoin season, here is a basic explanation:

In the earlier days, when the altcoin market was much smaller and Bitcoin had a market dominance of over 90 %, crypto basically meant bitcoin since the media and mainstream didn‘t know about any other coins or tokens.

But back then, it was observed that while of course the whole market makes gains when bitcoin does since most trading pairs are and were with BTC on the exchanges, many altcoins outperformed BTC very heavy right after it stopped moving and that alts in general always performed best right after a BTC bullrun. 

The explanation is quite simple: When BTC moons, fresh money and new people get into the crypto space through media attention and fomo, then it stopps at some point and suddenly many people panic sell their BTC. But they have made the step to learn about the blockchain, register to exchanges, many dig deeper and learn about alts. 

So a big part of the new people don’t cash out, but trade their BTC to alts. Therefore the back then compared to BTC very low cap alts mooned more then Bitcoin. 

There was not one BTC bullrun, but ‚seasons‘, usually it was said that if 75% of the Top 50 coins performed better than Bitcoin over the last season (90 days) it is officially Altcoin Season and everyone who knew about that concept got into altcoins, if Bitcoin got back dominance, they got back into BTC and so on. 

Since this concept got more famous and many people waited for the alt seasons to invest since the gains were much higher and the outcome easier to foresee, the effect was even stronger.

For your interest, you can still find the ‚altcoin season index‘ here:
https://www.blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index/

But my question is, is there still an altcoin season in 2021?

Since alts make about half of the crypto market cap now, BTC is not the only coin to bring new people into the crypto space anymore. There is also heavy media coverage about DOGE, SHIBA, ADA, SOL and some others now and everyone knows that there is more than one crypto coin and NFTs. Bitcoins dominance gets lower, but it‘s still 50 % of the whole market. But I‘d say, there are some more coins today that bring new people to crypto. 

So is there still something as an altcoin season? Like a classic BTC/ Altcoin season, or do we have other seasons now (like ETH/ ETH Killers, Dogecoins/ Fundamentals, DEX/CEX, …)?
Or is the whole concept outdated?

Hey guys, I have been following crypto for years now and have some questions about use in daily life.

1. With the price of bitcoin being volatile, how would businesses set prices for it? Would it be at the start or end of the day, or in the moment of the transaction?
2. Are payments convenient enough as they are now to facilitate trade of everyone in the world at the same time? I have heard transaction speed is a major flaw.
3. Without FDIC insurance, do people worry about a bank run? How do I avoid this problem, until the FDIC guarantees the money back in a bank?
4. What are the safest places to keep crypto right now?
5. With older people who may forget their passwords how do we protect these individuals? I know this has been a problem for younger people who invested early.
6. If we cannot reclaim bitcoin from accounts that people lost their passwords for, how do we continue bitcoin when the price gets so high easily divisible anymore?
7. It seems a lot of the problems I have asked here are gonna make crypto increasingly centralized, this will cause fear in many of the early adopters and seems to be one of the biggest arguments against it. Do people see this contradiction or anyway around it?
8. Some of these questions are focused on bitcoin and are solved with different coins, such as Ethereum. Allowing a system where people can go in and change the foundation of the coin can be a major threat to equality as we see with the government and the dollar. Is this a threat to the stability of coins in the future?
9. Is the scarce nature of bitcoin better, or a system like Ethereum where it is replaceable? I think the replaceability will make it safer in the going into the future, but I want to hear what the community says about it.
10. I have heard the main place people store bitcoin is on hard drives (I do not know if this is true or not.) Will this cause people to have to protect their hard drives more from thieves? Will we need to build safes in our house to hold our computers in?",Questions about Crypto,1634482604

***Methodology:***

*For Sentiment Analysis*

* Data collection for sentiments (comments) are performed everyday at 12PM UTC -8:00.
* The comments with less than 6 words are not included in the analysis anymore as many research papers argue them to be low quality sentiments.
* Another filter that is applied that a post or comment should at least have 2 or more upvotes to be included in analysis for this table.
* For this analysis, only one mention of a coin/token per user is considered.
* The sentiment analysis is performed using lexicon model and natural language processing ([nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) module for python).
* Emojis are also considered in sentiment analysis and are demojizied using [Python emoji library](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji/).

*For WordCloud and n-gram:*

*  A word cloud (aka a tag cloud) is **a visual representation of words** in a picture format. These representations are used to highlight popular words based on frequency and relevance. 
*  An N-gram means a sequence of N words. For example, for 1-gram or unigram, we consider the frequently occurring single words, for 2-gram or bigram, a sequence of two words and similarly a 3-gram or trigram a sequence of 3 words. They are basically a set of co-occurring words within a given text or in this case, this subreddit. 
* For the wordcloud and n-gram analysis, all the comments (without any filters) are collected and popular stop words are removed using ([nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) module for python).
* N-gram analysis is performed using  WordNetLemmatizer from nltk module for python.

***Feedback and request***:

* Feedbacks are welcome for presentation and reporting methods. 
* If you have any suggestions about the analysis method, you can let me know in the comments.
* In general, any advice for improvement is welcome. Thank you.

825,CryptoCurrency,Theoneandonlybigmoe,"Reporting Crypto on Taxes 

First. Take a deep breath and relax. It’s going to be okay even though the current tax code regulations are constantly changing and evolving. Don’t be alarmed as taxes can be daunting. No worries. You report just like you would other capital assets like stocks or real estate. 

You MUST realize that currently, crypto is treated as PROPERTY. Yes, you read that right. Property. Remember that. 

Here we go- 

Five (fairly) simple steps for filing and reporting. 

1. First and foremost, you HAVE to have income. Include this on your 1040 Schedule 1. Side note: this is different if you are engaged as self employed in the crypto space. In this case you would Schedule C. 

2. You will need to calculate your crypto taxes. You will need to know what your cap gains are as well as your losses. [There are apps out there that will do this for you]

3. Once you have this calculation, you will need to create and fill out IRS Form 8949. 

4. Fill in and include your total from your 8949 on your Schedule D- the form will actually tell you to do this. 

5.  Complete the rest of your tax return. Then file. 

See. It’s not that hard. The hardest part is tracking all of your transactions on a spreadsheet of some kind (they are out there as well) to be able to insert your numbers. 

Remember to do your own research. And, as always, this is not tax or financial advice. Hope this helps.

830,CryptoCurrency,jxvicinema,"I would like to share a short story about my little brother who started his first investment a month ago and it is crypto!

As someone who is myself new to crypto as well, I have been watching and researching crypto coins almost everyday as part of my daily routine. One day, my brother asked me for money and told him that he has to work for it. And so I gave him household chores like organizing the shoe racks, cook rice, and make coffee and juice for $20 biweekly (same day of me getting paid).

The funny thing when the pay day has come, he said he did not need the cash and instead he yelled “I want coins!”. I was amused and laughing at the same time because I never thought that a boy like his age would think about investment as his friends would prefer to buy robux instead.

As his older brother, I explained crypto investing basics to him and what were the pros and cons without any sugar coating. Right now, his $40 is invested in ADA and are being staked. I would be teaching him diversification the next time so he has the option to invest his well earned money to something else.

To be honest, I wish I was like him
when I was younger, thinking about investment in such an early age is such a game changer. I’m happy and proud of my little brother, and I’m rooting for his success. Sharing crypto to our family members is not always a bad thing, let us influence them in a good way.

I've heard of some people using ETH as collateral against a loan. If you don't pay, my understanding is that the asset will be seized, which is not taxed.

The downside of this method is that you have little control over when the seizure of assets happens, so it's unlikely that you will fetch an optimal price.

Bennet says Dogecoin is now consolidating and if the crypto is able to reclaim the $0.24 level, it may result in a multi-month price surge. “If this breaks higher, targets like $0.32, $0.42, and $0.57 are well within reach,” Bennet indicated. “However, keep in mind that a daily close above the upper trend line near $0.245 is required to confirm the breakout.”

Bennet says if the $0.24 level is broken and held, he expects price to pump to the previous high of $0.26, before returning to $0.24 and retesting the level before surging higher.

Bennet is analyzing the daily chart for Dogecoin and notes the formation of a large triangle pattern, according to a report from the Daily Hodl.

I found different article online, but no specific discussion getting into details about the best ever (if ever exists) browser for security. As I understand metamask if enough safe if paired with a ledger, even if there was some problem (data leak in 2020). At the same time I am starting realising how much chrome, can be tricky to use with metamask so I am thinking about other alternative combinations of browser/wallet. I read about brave but I really wonder how safe is compared to chrome or Firefox.
For example brave is more strict when comes to extension, which could make it more safe.

Metamask on the other side looks pretty naive to me, it is not just the ui, but is the general lack of support, (the guys are very slow to reply). I am thinking to migrate to something like trust wallet. But again I can’t really say what are the difference in details in terms of security. 

I’m general I have heard very strange things happening to people through chrome/metamask. Most of the problems come because of laziness I am sure, but there must be some browser that for trading crypto is better and more secure.

Below shows another perfect example where crypto would have totally prevented this confrontation: 

TLDR: Two men with 100K in cash stopped by police, arrested for no crime, and their cash confiscated due to looking suspicious. The 2 men were on the way to buy some land in Oklahoma to use for farming. 

In case of paywall:

*A pair of New Mexico businessmen were driving along Interstate 40 in Oklahoma late one night in April when a sheriff’s deputy flipped on his lights and sirens and pulled over their BMW sedan.*

*The two men, Nang Thai and Weichuan Liu, were on their way to a hotel in Oklahoma City. They planned to catch some sleep before heading out in the morning to close on a 10-acre plot of farmland they’d agreed to buy for $100,000.*

*“We didn’t understand why he pulled us over,” said Thai, 51, a Vietnamese immigrant and father of two from Albuquerque. “I was driving under the speed limit.”*

*They had no way of knowing at the time but Thai and Liu were about to begin an hours long ordeal that would leave them stripped of all their cash and searching for answers. Their experience highlights the controversial law enforcement practice known as civil asset forfeiture, in which police can confiscate a person’s cash or other property even without bringing criminal charges.*

*After a second officer arrived at the scene, the men were driven to a police station and interrogated for hours. Deputies emptied a backpack and suitcase full of cash, then pulled apart the inside of the BMW but apparently turned up no guns, drugs or any other illicit items.*

*Thai said he told his interrogators they had saved up the money for years and were planning to use the land for farming but hadn’t yet determined which crops to raise.*

*“They kept saying, ‘This is illegal money,’” Thai said. “I said, ‘Okay, prove it. We didn't do anything illegal.’”*

*The men are now fighting to get it back. Adding insult to injury, they contend that the amount the sheriff’s office says it confiscated – $131,500 – is actually $10,000 short of the total they had in their car that day.*

*“Now I have to prove I’m innocent, and they are the ones who illegally took my money and basically stole some of my money, too,” said Thai.*",Another great example for the need for a full use of Crypto. This could be avoided,1634484688

870,CryptoCurrency,Yearn4Knowledge,"I've been waiting for this day for some time now. It's finally time for my first post, and I wanted to make it a worthwhile contribution to the community. Since I've been thinking about this for a while, I apologize in advance for this being long-winded.

What I thought I would do is simply share some general knowledge based on my first-hand experiences over the last few years in the crypto space. By no means is this comprehensive, and it is only my personal opinion. So, take this all with a grain of salt.

P.S. None of this is in any particular order. It's a pure knowledge dump in the rawest form. Also, I'm based in the USA, so some of this may not be applicable to those in other parts of the world.

# Multi-Factor Authentication

Please use MFA on EVERY account you have. I'm not just talking about crypto here. Email, social media, shopping sites...anything and everything you can enable MFA on - do it. And, wherever available, use an MFA app as opposed to SMS-based MFA. My app of choice is Authy simply for the fact that it's very easy to move between phones or recover if your phone is lost or damaged.

# SIM Protection

In a perfect world, everything would use OTP apps instead of SMS. But, as many of you know, some sites only offer SMS. Sure, it's better than nothing, but it's weakness is the SIM swap attack. The best thing you can do is log in (or contact) your cell phone provider and enable additional protections for your SIM. Some offer a PIN you can enable, others have a verification process. Whatever it is, enable it! Also, if you have an iPhone, you can enable a [SIM PIN](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201529). Every time you power on your phone, you have to enter this PIN for your SIM to activate. Just another nice layer of security in case your phone or your SIM are stolen.

# Whitelisting

Every time I set up a new exchange or crypto app, I enable whitelisting. The concept is relatively simple. You define your list of authorized wallets your funds can be withdrawn to. Once they're added, there is now a hold period if any changes are made. If someone gets your login credentials and somehow gets past your MFA, they still have to wait a few days before they can withdraw funds to any wallets they're in control of. This gives you ample time to stop the attack before they can steal your crypto.

# Track Your Transactions!

Alright, with all that security stuff out of the way, let me share my biggest lesson learned. Every time you buy, sell, move, or are rewarded with crypto, TRACK IT. Trust me, if you wait to do this later, you will be in a world of hurt. I didn't wait too long, but still had close to 1,000 transactions to go back and record. And believe me, not all exchanges/platforms are created equal for their reporting. If you don't know how or where to begin, create a simple spreadsheet and track the following:

1. The exchange, platform, or wallet where the transaction took place
2. The date of the transaction
3. The crypto ticker symbol
4. The type of transaction (Buy, Sell, Transfer In, Transfer Out, Reward/Interest)
5. The amount of the crypto that was transacted
6. The dollar value of the coin at the time of the transaction
7. Any fees paid for the transaction

I personally use both a spreadsheet and CoinMarketCap to track every transaction. I strongly recommend everyone always use a spreadsheet for one reason: In the future, you can better calculate your realized and unrealized gains across platforms. CMC is a good start, but it won't give you that level of detail to make really informed decisions about profit taking and ROI. CMC also doesn't let you track rewards or interest in their own category. When I earn a reward, I really like to know how much those rewards have gained, as well as how much in total rewards/interest I've yielded.

# Learn How To Use A ""Pro"" Exchange

There are so many ways to buy crypto these days; and many of those apps make it so simple to deposit and trade. But you will pay through the nose in fees or spreads and not even realize it. It can feel overwhelming at first, but I strongly recommend you learn basic stock-trading concepts like Limit Orders, the Order Book, and the Ask/Bid price. Once you're comfortable with those concepts, use the pro version of an exchange and always use Limit Orders for your buys/sells. You will save yourself a staggering amount in fees over time. After trying over a dozen exchanges and platforms, my all time favorite is Gemini Active Trader Pro. It has a relatively limited number of coins compared to other popular options. But the the total transaction cost including the withdrawal is almost impossible to beat in my experience.

# Let's Talk About Fees

It is WAY too easy to lose your butt in fees with crypto. Exchanges or other platforms charge a fee for each transaction, some like to charge a ""spread"" which is even worse, you have to pay network fees to move crypto between wallet addresses...it all adds up. If you don't trade often, and you trade in large amounts, you're not going to notice it. But if you're an average person like me who dollar cost averages on a weekly basis, you'll waste a significant portion of your investment to fees.

What's my strategy? I ACH transfer fiat into Gemini Active Trader Pro (free), I buy my crypto using a limit order at a price that won't get filled immediately (so I can guarantee I'm a ""Maker"" and get the lowest fee), wait the 5 day hold period, and then withdraw to Celsius (my preferred CeFi platform). My only fee in that entire transaction is the .25% maker fee, which I find to be more than fair considering I pay zero withdrawal/network fees.

The best part? When I'm ready to sell or move off Celsius, I can either withdraw back to Gemini or to my hardware wallet for free! So, I get to buy and sell all I want and never pay anything more than that low fee to Gemini.

As an added note, I also hold some funds in USDC, which Gemini does not support. So, in the case where I need to buy/sell USDC, I use BlockFi. BlockFi only allows one free stablecoin withdrawal per calendar month, so I just have to limit those transactions to avoid unnecessary fees.

# Hardware Wallets

I recommend everyone gets a hardware wallet. And no, this is not necessarily because of the ""Not your keys, not your crypto"" argument. I find two very positive benefits of having a hardware wallet:

1. This is one of the best ways to learn how blockchains work and how crypto is moved between wallets. Once you get comfortable using a hardware wallet, everything else becomes second nature.
2. A hardware wallet is a fantastic safety net. I hold most of my crypto on CeFi platforms. But, this crypto space is still very much in its infancy, and you never know what could happen to one of these platforms. If I start to feel uncomfortable or see the writing on the wall, I can withdraw all my crypto to my hardware wallet in minutes. Every time I set up a new exchange or CeFi platform, I always whitelist my hardware wallet addresses so I'm ready in a moments notice. I also do a few test transfers a couple times a year just to make sure everything is working as it should.

My hardware wallet of choice: Ledger Nano X.

# Earning Yield

This is one of my favorite aspects of crypto. It's also one of the most polarizing in this community. As I mentioned before, I personally hold most of my crypto on CeFi platforms such as Celsius (my current favorite). Others will argue the dangers of this and recommend people control their own crypto on hardware wallets and via staking. I completely understand and respect this other argument, and I definitely think it's appropriate for some. Really, this is just a risk-tolerance argument. Everyone's tolerance is different, and that's perfectly okay. You do you.

For me, I love using platforms like Celsius to earn yield on my crypto. Not only do I get to hold an appreciating asset, but then I get to earn interest on top of that. And that interest is also an appreciating asset, compounding over time. I'm not wealthy and don't have a lot to invest. But, my yields from interest every year are enough to cover my annual property taxes among a few other expenses, and that's nothing to scoff at.

# IRAs

Now this is an aspect of crypto that I'm shocked more people don't understand or take advantage of. We're always talking about how we're in it for the long term, and how we do our best to avoid capital gains taxes. But very few people know that you can kill two birds with a crypto IRA. Here are a few notable benefits of a Roth IRA (my personal choice):

1. Any crypto you buy inside your IRA grows TAX FREE.
2. When I retire, I get to cash out my crypto TAX FREE.
3. If I get in a pinch, I can withdraw any contributions I made to the IRA TAX AND PENALTY FREE.

I did something very few are comfortable doing: I had an emergency fund ($15k) sitting in a traditional savings account with a bank. I opened a Roth IRA with iTrust Capital in December of 2020 and contributed $6k of my emergency fund into it (the max annual contribution). In January, I contributed another $6k. I invested in the cryptos of my choice, and over the next year that IRA more than doubled. Now, at any time I desire, I can withdraw up to $12k out of that account without penalty or without any capital gains tax. The rest of the funds have to sit there until I retire. But hey, it's free money!

As I said, iTrust Capital is my personal pick for this one. There are several options on the market, but they were a clear winner in my book. I'll be happy to write another post just on this if anyone is interested.

# Dollar Cost Averaging

If you've made it this far, then you'll see that I hold all my crypto in two primary places: Celsius and iTrust Capital. As great as it is to be able to grow my crypto holdings tax-free in my IRA, I'm limited to how much I can contribute each year, and it's not nearly as ""liquid"" as Celsius. Plus, Celsius gives me the ability to borrow against my crypto for extremely low interest rates, which has some awesome use cases.

So, I still buy and hold quite a bit outside of my IRA. My strategy:

1. My bank (Ally) has this feature called ""Round Ups."" Any every couple weeks, all my individual bank transactions are rounded up the nearest dollar and then moved into my Ally savings account. Every time they do that, I take those round ups and buy a little crypto. It's not much, but it's a really consistent way of DCA'ing.
2. Credit card rewards! Of course, I had the BlockFi Credit Card and took full advantage of the 3.5% cashback for the first 90 days. After that, I switched back to my regular credit card which is a flat 2% cash back on everything. Every single month, when my cash back rewards are paid out, I buy some more crypto. Once again, it's not a ton, but it's consistent.
3. Finally, I have a set, bi-weekly amount I invest. I have a reminder on my phone so I don't forget. I don't care about the price at the time. I just set a limit order and let it do its thing.

# Learn And Earn

This is another super cool aspect of crypto. It's not going to make you rich, but it's free money! I think the most consistent and common option is Coinbase's Learn and Earn program. You get a notification whenever there is a new option available, you watch 3 quick animated explainers, answer 1 quiz question after each one, and earn a little bit of crypto (usually $1 for each quiz, $3 total). To date I've earned $50 doing these, and some of those have seen some nice gains. Of course, I could easily cash these out each time and buy my favorite crypto. But I like to hold on to them just in case 10 years down the road one of them rockets in price. There's an extremely slim chance they will. But, I see them almost like free lottery tickets. If I win, amazing. If I don't, oh well.

While games like Axie Infinity did indeed gain popularity, we are only at the beginning!

In gaming there is something called **""AAA or Triple-A games"" which are video games produced or developed by a major publisher**, which allocated a huge budget for both development and marketing.

After my EC card was unexpectedly rejected in the supermarket yesterday, there was mail from Comdirect in the mailbox today:

Cancellation of the entire account with two months notice.

This comes as a surprise, as I have been a customer there for six years, have never had an overdraft and have used my account and credit card very actively.

So I called them directly and asked about it. The woman on the phone then finally admitted, after some initial phrases, that the cancellation took place because I had received transfers from a crypto exchange (Kraken) in recent weeks and this was undesirable.

Super. It's legal, but puts everyone under general suspicion who has something to do with crypto.

But the best was yet to come. When I wanted to transfer the credit to an account at another institution after the phone call, the transfer was rejected with the note that it was blocked, I should contact customer service.

So I called them again, this time with much more anger. Now a man on the phone, he told me that it was strange that transfers are blocked, since the cancellation actually only takes effect at the end of December. 

He can now only arrange a check, which will take a week. The best thing for me to do is to write a letter asking him to transfer the money to an external account.

So mining is just too slow and not profitable with this card.

I still can return the PC and this is what I will very likely do. 

I plan now to buy another one with an AMD card that are a bit cheaper and do not have this stupid LHR. At least I can use the card for gaming and mining.

I will go probably for the AMD Redeon 5700 XT that (I hope) can have a better hashrate (the nvidea with overclocking I could get maximum 32 Mhs, most of the time around 26).

&amp;#x200B;

So just keep in mind, avoid Nvidea new cards if you also want to mine coins.

and btw if someone could suggest a decent card for gaming + mining would appreciate :)

cheers",Changing from Nvidea to AMD,1634397341
935,CryptoCurrency,leondrehp,"I was looking into this token called Red Floki, i saw it's been doing massive numbers daily. It launched on the 13th of october sitting around 5M market cap.   They're looking to hit the 100M market cap. I looks interesting and if it can actually hit the 100M market cap it would be a good investment.

943,CryptoCurrency,PornSoftware,"After a lot of experimentation and testing I have come to a lot of the same conclusions that others have regarding the crypto gaming industry.
For the sake of keeping this short, there are a few points that I want to address as a developer and I’m hoping to get some feedback here because we all want a healthy market for this stuff.

1) Requiring a user to buy anything upfront or at all is the devil. 
2) People would rather just play the damn game and if the crypto is cool or earnable, great.
3) Keep-it-simple, I’m a programmer and I get a headache reading some of this stuff.  It also just comes off as a scam because it is confusing.

So we know that networked games cost.  In my experience, you’ll be paying at least $120/mo in hosting if you roll out your own chain and it’s a (very) small mmo. This figure is based on my own experience developing these types of projects.  And for some of you that is cheap but for say, an indie developer, looking to check out this space it’s not really because that fluctuates (typically upward over time).

So then we need to talk about fundraising.  You really can’t, unless you do an ICO (assuming you have your own coin/token) or similar which brings us back to the nuances of #1.  Somebody has to pay for these games and mainstream gamers absolutely will not (and largely kind of hate crypto anything) but if you’re lucky they’ll check it out.

This leaves crypto enthusiasts to foot the bill but that actually works because once they buy into any crowdfunding-oriented pre-sale they now have a game currency ready to use and flex on all those gamers. And probably some profit by the time it comes out. Or they can just use it all in the game. I think that’s cool!

Except if you have your own token it’s considered centralized and now the crypto people kind of hate you too. But they might make some…money? It’s toxic and that’s a bad sentiment for the nascent crypto games business.

In conclusion some developers (including myself) have watered down how just crypto the crypto game is. And nuked our own custom projects to support things like BTC in-game instead. Since it just “looked better” while incurring the same costs with less of the upside.  Since don’t have a supply of our own cryptocurrency to reward anyone or fund the game, and instead need to take fees from micro-transactions which nobody really likes in any context.  I’m typing this up because a lot of crypto game devs are worried that we are already losing runway and success now seems to be based purely on hype and not solving real problems like these. These hype cycles only attract retail investors who don’t care about these problems. Or so it seems.  And so I’m here to get some thoughts on this and hear about what your favorite crypto game is and why.",On Crypto Game Business Models,1634397928

That's alright.

Ignorance is bliss, as they say. We were perfectly content to live in a world where Wallstreet and the FED front-run all fiat transactions, with whale addresses performing sandwich and 51% attacks on a daily basis without any transparency. The fiat tokenomics also favor whale addresses in every airdrop and mining reward, as they were the first to get the first batches of mined fiat. 

The big dream back then was to graduate and beg to get accepted into some fiat mining pools where devs are 70% toxic and you have to run your corpse flesh mining rig for 40 hours a day till 65. The world ran on fiat and  fiat devs are more often than not anon, and are shady as fuck, and due to their coding incompetence, double spending exploits occur every day, and 100% all fiat codes are not audited. Because tokenomics are bad, inflation in some fiat coins can get very high, but this only affects krill wallets, because whale wallets already are earning yields in exclusive clubs. 

100% all contracts were non-smart, so banks can charge you up to 2% on a total contract's value to perform a non-smart contract interaction. So a $10 million transaction can incur a fee of $200,000 and a week to finalize.

The big whales that took absurd amount of risks and lost all their money in shitcoin trading were bailed out by the government, so they can start new pools to  bet on more shitcoins in the future.

My name is Luís Rodrigues and I recently developed a standalone app for WearOS, which I think it might be of interest for some of you. It's my first smartwatch app, and I put a lot of effort on polishing it the best I could.

For some context, I started investing on stocks and crypto at the start of this year. I even used my PC to mine while I was away; fast forward a few months, and I decided to make my own smartwatch tracker.

&amp;nbsp;

Long story short, it consists on **tracking stocks &amp; crypto, with a clean and smooth design**.

It's completely **free**, aside from a one-time purchase to unlock more customization options.

&amp;nbsp;

Regarding the crypto tickers:

While it can't track all existing crypto, it can certainly track most of the ""big ones"". To track a crypto, you'd usually *add the ticker followed by ""-USD""* (e.g. BTC-USD, ETH-USD, ADA-USD, and so on)

953,CryptoCurrency,grochszeczek,"I'm not a veteran by any means and I'm small time, but I still want to share little tricks that I came up with and maybe start a discussion.

First of all, I live in Poland, so I use this Polish exchange called BitBay to buy because they have good prices, low trading fees and they accept wire transfers in my currency (PLN). Obviously this might differ for you. The thing about BitBay is 1. They have a good, but still relatively small selection of coins 2. They withdrawal fees don't make sense; for example an ETH withdrawal costs a flat 0.01ETH, which is insane. So I buy XLM, which costs almost nothing to withdraw/transfer. XLM is the perfect tool to transfer between exchanges. Maybe try to find a similar deal in your region.

Then I transfer to Coinbase, if they happen to have the coin that I want. I exchange the XLM to whatever is my choice, which I think costs like 0.5%. After that, my favorite step - transfer my purchase to Coinbase Pro. It's free and super easy, just use the Deposit button in Portfolio after you log in to CBP. And the best part: crypto withdrawals from CBP only cost a small network fee, which I think is often lower than the actual transfer cost at the time! It's like it's free! This was a life changing discovery for me.

Anyway, what's your tips and tricks? It doesn't have to be a whole process, just share any small nuggies of knowledge and tricks that you found, even if it's for your region only - someone from there might read it and it might save them a couple bucks. Also, maybe there is something that I can do better in my process?

As such many Ledger customers receive threats via email or phone, constant spam and in some more severe cases some people actually were targeted by burglars who knew through the leak that there possibly is crypto in their home.

**Polkadot outage on their App**

Since a couple of days, more specifically since 13 October, Polkadot is not functioning on their app and you cannot unstake, unbond, withdraw or do anything that involves Polkadot and Ledger.

Well no biggie right, just wait and it will be fine, funds are safu. Well no, thats not the case. Funds are safe but actually the fact that Polkadot crowdloans and auctions start November 11 is what makes this a HUGE DEAL!!!

For those who dont know Polkadot recently announced a date for the much awaited auctions that will take place on its ecosystem, allowing for projects to claim one of the positions on the Polkadot ecosystem to deploy their product. This is a major move for the DOT and the ecosystem and after a succesful launch on the KUSAMA network, Polkadots canary network aka test subject, people are more excited than ever.

Basically what you can do is offer your DOT in return for a payment in the form of the token of the project you support. Best part is after a certain time (usually 2 years) you get both your DOT back and the rewards of the project token!

This is where the problem arises though and where LEDGER is fkn us up. If you are smart and stake DOT for passive income (around 10% APY) you would want to unstake and unbond your DOT, a process that takes 28 days. To prepare for the crowd-loans you would have to do this latest on 13 October so that the DOT is usable on 10 November a day before the corwdloans start. 

Well the outage is still going and it is too late. I was planning to unstake last minute to benefit from the rewards as much as i can, and i got rekt by LEDGER.

I guess now i will have to buy more DOT and use that instead, but then again i wont have as much DOT as i would have liked to have since im not planning on making DOT such a huge part of my portfolio.

**Conclusion**

This goes to show how important it is to have more than one wallet that you rely on. Im actually looking into getting another wallet probably trezor once i take some profits. unfortunately i cannot sell my Ledgers lol, but at the same time i would not i would still keep 1 Ledger and spread my funds on 1 Ledger and 1 Trezor.

It also goes to show that Ledger is become a shit company. They are not sharing any additional info on the situation other than that there is an outage and its just seems to be ignored kinda. So thats sad cause as i said i really like their product.",Ledger is f$%&amp;ing up constantly what is wrong with this company.,1634398953

I asked if Coinbase was blocked and they said I could still use Coinbase so I said are you aware I can still buy cryptocurrency on Coinbase and send it Binance? They said they can’t comment. So looks like I can’t use it to buy Harmony One in there now which is really annoying. Do any UK folks know of any banks that still allow Binance? And if not how do you get around it? It’s going to be expensive buying stable coins on Coinbase then sending to Binance to make purchases.

Me: Is it the same for Coinbase or just binance?

Nationwide: This is just Binance specifically.

Me: Is there a reason for this? I may have to change my account based on that

Nationwide: I can confirm the reason Nationwide has this policy regarding Binance is due to a rising number of scams and regulatory uncertainty.

978,CryptoCurrency,Scary_Milk,"Most of us use exchanges or wallets to store their crypto. But what happens if you have an accident that leaves you in a state where you can‘t access these anymore? Maybe your relatives know about your banking account, but what about your crypto?

Here are only some of probably thousands of stories:

- In 2018, Gerald Cotten, the CEO of the crypto exchange Quadriga, unexpectedly died at age 30, allegedly taking with him the private keys to $250m worth of his clients’ cryptocurrency.

- Also in 2018, Mathew Mellon, a businessman who’d turned a $2m investment in the cryptocurrency Ripple into a reported $500m+, died without telling anyone where his private keys were stored. His wallets have yet to be located.

- In 2013, a 26-year-old Bitcoin miner named Matthew Moody died in a plane crash, leaving behind no way to access thousands of dollars’ worth of crypto. Years later, his father is still trying to recover the funds.

So I thought about what you can do to provide these situations and make your crypto get into the hands you want them to be after you leave this planet.

1. Use a password manager to store all of your financial accounts information, including usernames, passwords and private keys to your digital assets. Share your master password with someone you trust or store it with your will.
This is most likely the best solution, but you need someone you really trust or pay a lawyer. 

1. Use a digital wallet (web-based or hardware) or digital exchange to store and manage your Bitcoin and other crypto assets. You can give your family access to your wallet, or the exchange may have a death-management process (Coinbase has this feature for example). 
Not really my way to go since I‘m from the ‚not your keys, not your coins‘ club, but maybe the easiest solution. 

3. Create and maintain a list of your financial assets and give access to your executor or a trusted family member or friend. Remember to review and update your list annually or whenever you acquire new digital assets.
Create a will instructing how you want your crypto assets to be distributed.
The most professional solution and maybe something everyone should add to their last will.

990,CryptoCurrency,AlexWasTakenWasTaken,"The SEC has now finally approved a Bitcoin Futures ETF. However it seems like the sentiment about this in terms of price movement for Bitcoin is not where it should be. People think that purchases of a futures ETF will have almost no affect on the spot price of BTC, which is absolutely untrue.   
Let me elaborate, as this might blow your mind.

**Technical Analysis**

When a futures ETF launches, there will be way more buying than selling pressure. We can see this already, because futures on exchanges trade for a much higher price than BTC spot. On FTX, the BTC-0325 Future is trading at 65'600$ while BTC is trading at 61'080$. 

When futures ETFs launch, they too will reflect higher prices than the Bitcoin spot price. What will risk-averse, smart investors do? They will short the high ETF price, BUY BTC spot on a lower price and pocket the difference. Currently doing this on an exchange would yield a 7.5% risk-less return within the next 6 months.

*ELI5?: I will now spot-buy Bitcoin for 61k and sell it to you for 65k BTC on March 25th. I can arrange and fix this sales price by shorting the ETF now. I have made 4k of secure profits.*

As you can see in this example, the availability of a futures ETF directly affected the spot demand of BTC. With more and more ETFs launching and trillions of dollars being directed towards them, price spreads will increase and so will the buying pressure on spot markets. This is huge and many have yet to understand this.

**General Analysis**

The approval of a Bitcoin Futures ETF on Wall Street will legitimize the asset once and for all in the US. It brings the credibility of crypto to a new level for many higher-ups in finance.

Also, regulation is still one of the biggest risks we're facing. The further crypto can spread, the harder it will be to regulate crypto in a way that is harmful to the financial industry. And an ETF is doing exactly this, no matter whether it is futures-based or not. You cannot take down something that is so deeply connected to the economy. Once people allocate their 401k, IRAs etc. regulators will be even more weary of hurting the crypto space.

**Summary**

The launch of a US futures based BTC ETF is huge, both from a technical and general perspective. It is untrue that it won't directly affect spot prices and this will soon become clear to us all.",Why a futures-based ETF will massively affect the spot price of BTC - A technical and general analysis,1634399994

Tinyman has welcomed 43277 accounts in total. As expected, we have seen the biggest participation in the swapping feature with 192879 transactions. However, the most salient part of the swaps is not about their total amount, but their sizes. We have a median swap value of only 7.9$ at Tinyman! That means, half of the swaps that occurred were below this 7.9$ mark, and moreover, 95% of all these swaps were under 560$. The transaction fees spent for these swaps were 771 Algos in total, keeping the average expenditure per swap to be less than 1 ¢!

I am a Buy and HODLer since early 2017, but thought I’d share my girlfriends experience at her new employer CHASE. [look here](https://observer.com/2021/10/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase-bitcoin-worthless-interview/amp/) 

As most of us know the CHASE bank CEO just came out saying that BTC is worthless and crypto currency is a worthless investment. 

Well she has a branch manager that has been with the company for 12 years. At one point he was a private client banker (these are bankers that only work with clients with 1m+ of chase product i.e. loans and fiat). He told her that he had a client for the last 6 years out in CA was buying 20k of BTC a month. He consistently told this client that it was not smart and he would lose all of his money. He continued to tell the client this and the client continued to ignore him. 

She didn’t ask, but do you guys think that the banking world has recognized the coming of Crypto since 2015?! If so that would be nuts. 

This same branch manager still told her that crypto is worthless. She knows I am deep in crypto and give no f*cks, as my license plate says JUSTHODL and my c8 Z06 I order will have that plate transferred to it.

Like prior they were taxed because the IRS didn't view them as a religion and they did something nasty to get that change.

In short, they didn't sue the IRS itself. They sued the people working at the IRS, kept suing them, keep PI going after them to find anything little they done wrong and reported it to their city, HOA, or whatever to make their life a living hell. So like following workers with cameras to show cops the person was speeding or breaking random traffic laws. Finding ways to sue them.

But, instead of holding and being grateful for my luck, I decided to go all-in on a new coin I never heard of. (I have a addictive personality, and honestly, until I make millions, I will probably never be satisfied with my earnings) 

Normally, I never would invest in a coin like the one that I have… But, It found me right after a interesting time in my life. 

My wife passed away this year, and her memorial took place on August 8, 2021. 

August 8th was a day that I dreaded, a day that I was avoiding and didn’t want to come. But, then turned into one of the most memorable days of my life…

When I first arrived to my wife’s memorial; I was greeted by an odd looking individual named Sky, (gay, patchy haired, make-up, and wearing a wide variety of vibrant colored clothing and jewelry) a man I apparently met through my wife years ago when she worked at the bar that he frequently visited. I did not recognize him, honestly, I had no recollection of our meetings. But, he remembered me… and honestly, he was the only person who seemed to know exactly what I needed at this time. He came right up to me, gave me a huge hug, and said “hey man, I know you probably don’t remember me, but, I love you, your wife was the most amazing person, and I am extremely sorry for you loss, your wife meant the world to me.” He then walked away, and I went about solemnly until, finally, the memorial ended.

After the memorial, I decided to go and spend the rest of my day at a memorial bench I had bought in her remembrance, one of her favorite spots I knew she loved. 

When I arrived at the bench, sure enough, I saw the same odd looking fellow that first greeted me at the memorial. Oddly, I hadn’t told anyone else yet about this bench… At first, I was pretty bummed out, for I was really just wanting to spend some alone time with my thoughts, but, then I remembered his comment that he made. So, instead of turning around and walking away, I decided to sit down and pick up a conversation with Sky. First, I asked how he had heard about this bench, and he told me that he actually had no idea it was here, rather, this was the same spot he and my wife had met. We shared many stories, and I was very surprised to discover that he was actually very successful. Come to find out, he owned a bookstore downtown that he had inherited when he was younger, but, that wasn’t the key to his success, he shared with me how he actually use to trade books, in exchange for Pokémon cards, Bitcoin, as well as Dogecoin…?!?! (Obviously, before any were worth any value) In addition, he was actually rather intelligent, and it seemed we had a lot in common. Making great conversation…This individual, someone who I never would of talked to, solely based on his appearance, was actually rather awesome! 

I had brought with me a bottle of Middleton, my wife’s favorite drink, which I shared over the course of the many hours we sat there talking. When the sun began to set, we decided to say our farewells. Upon leaving, he shared with me how he dreaded this day, until now, and thanked me… Then nonchalantly pulls out a vial from his pocket and drops a liquid onto his tongue. Acid. Asking me if I would like a drop myself.

I had never taken Acid before, so of course, I did what any other person with an addictive personality would do, and extended my tongue. He gave me a drop, then we parted ways. 

At first, I thought that it wasn’t working, that maybe because I was drunk, it just counter acted my drunkness, and ultimately, I felt like it just completely sobered me up. Oh, how I was wrong, i mean, it sobered me up alright, but once I got back to my hotel the magic began to unfold. 

Eventually I found myself wandering downtown, where I ran into one of my old childhood friends, ironically enough, she was actually headed to one of her friends birthday party’s, at his house they called “the plot thickens”, where they all were planning on dropping acid… She sold me at “the plot thickens”, but also explained how they were all in the circus, had a bounce house, an aerial trapeze, a bunch of other crazy things that sounded absolutely insane, but amazing at the same time (especially when you are on acid). 

We eventually arrive, and no shit, the owner of “the plot thickens” is the magical fairy himself, thee same magical fairy who instilled upon me; a single minty drop that contained the whole world within. Sky… 

I woke up the next morning, and remember looking at my phone, and this coin called out to me… It seemed to good to be true, but also, it seemed to manifest itself into my life.. A coin that had combined two things, things that I felt could have made me a lot of money in my life.

Thing 1) Pokémon; while deployed my mom gave away my 151 all mint condition original Pokémon cards, and thing 2) Dogecoin; my first ever crypto investment, which I sold for profits right before this years huge run-up… Obviously, being high on acid fucked with my brain, and I began to really manifest my thoughts down a rabbit hole…. 

I mainly blame astrology though, because the acid night was absolutely surreal and amazing, turning a dreaded day, into one of my most memorable happiest days of my life… Acid is one hell of a drug… Anyways, me being a Leo, I had to of course read this during my research down this rabbit hole… 

Get ready to manifest some serious Leo season magic, because on Aug. 8, the Leo sun and the bright star Sirius will create an annual cosmic alignment known as the lion’s gate portal. This spiritual vibe is being amplified even more intensely this year, thanks to the new moon in Leo that’s taking place on the same day. Between these stellar events and the numerology behind the number eight, August 8 (or 8/8) is set to be one of the luckiest days of 2021. If you're into astrology or numerology, you don't want to sleep on this opportunity to manifest abundance and dream big.

Oh, I manifested abundance and dreamed real big that night… So big, I decided to go ALL IN on this coin. 

Currently, I am down more than 80%… Even after DCAing in… Unfortunately, I have ran out of money to keep buying the dip… I honestly, even quit all 3 of my jobs, because I am convinced that this wasn’t all a coincidence… That you can manifest reality, and that life is all about what we confess…

Anyways, I’ve probably just melted my brain, so I figured I might as well share this story with all of you.

Moral of the story: DYOR, but maybe, it’s not a good idea to do so after dropping Acid. Or, maybe it is? I am still holding… No reason to sell now.",A Crypto Story,1634310178

***The full blog post with all the tables is*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-33)***.***

Welcome! This is the monthly report for my homemade 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund. This group contains **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, XLM, USDT, LTC, BSV**, and **Tron.**

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for over 3.5 years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, and 2021. ***Learn more about the history, rules, and FAQs of the Experiments (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **September Winners and Losers** \- in an all red month, **Tron** lost the least; **EOS** had the worst Sept.
* **Overall since Jan. 2019** \- **ETH** and **BTC** leading the pack. Portfolio up +510% vs. S&amp;P's +74% vs. Total Crypto Market Cap's +1,562% over same time period.
* **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +405%.**

## Month Thirty-Three – UP 510%  

https://preview.redd.it/lnpxvamnqmt71.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=600d63e4f25e29fa46403f58d655615351e3e26f

The 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, EOS, Stellar, USDT, Litecoin, BSV,** and **Tron**.  

September highlights for the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* The portfolio followed an [all green August ](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-33)with an all red September.
* **Tron** inched out **BTC** for best performer this month, **EOS** worst performing
* **ETH**  and **BTC** are leading the pack and carrying the entire portfolio. **Ethereum**  is up +2,300% since January 2019.

## September Movement Report, Ranking, and Dropouts

All of the 2019 cryptos either maintained their place or fell in the rankings this month:

Ups: None

Downs:

* **BSV** – down 8 places (#46–#54)
* **EOS** – down 7 places (#33–&gt;#40)
* **Bitcoin Cash** – down 4 places (#14–&gt;#18)
* **Stellar** – down 1 place (#22–&gt;#23) 

https://preview.redd.it/9a956jepqmt71.png?width=406&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae5e4b18f22275f0ae3011f242da923e7d920f47

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2019:** After thirty-three months, 60% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten in January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/)  have been knocked out.  **EOS**, **Litecoin, BSV, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash,** and **Tron** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Cardano**, **DOT, SOL**, **Doge**, and **USDC.**   

**BSV** has fallen the furthest so far – it is the only crypto that has dropped out of the Top *Fifty*. 

## September Winners and Losers 

***September Winners*** – Besides **Tether**, all cryptos finished in the red.  **Tron** (-2.7%) and **BTC** (-3.3%) lost the least ground.

***September Losers*** –  **EOS** and **BSV** had a tough month dropping -20% and -19.4% respectively.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

Which crypto holds the most wins or losses over the life of the project?  Here’s a snapshot of the winners and losers over the first thirty-three months of the 2019 Top Ten Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/9ldeg4pqqmt71.png?width=411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c5c284a43559069a06f5887ca2ef68f9612f638

By a large margin, **Tether** has the greatest number of monthly victories (10) followed by **BTC** with five.  

Every crypto has won at least one month since [January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/) and **BSV** has the most losses: it has underperformed its peers 11 out of 33 months (or 33% of the time).

## Overall Update –  ETH far ahead of 2nd place BTC, all cryptos in positive territory, BSV worst performing

**ETH** is easily the best performer of this group, up 2,300% as of this report, almost double the ROI of second place **BTC** (+1172%) over the same period of time.

**The $100 investment into first place ETH on** [**January 1st, 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/) **is currently worth $2,463.**

After thirty-three months, 100% of the cryptos in the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio are in positive territory. Not counting stablecoin **Tether**, the worst performing crypto is **BSV**, which is up  +47%.   

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/3eqxq5ctqmt71.png?width=522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78944c9fb1a5dc05585608a6c08bb578ada1361c

The total crypto market lost about $108B in September, settling at just over $2.1T.  

The entire cryptocurrency sector is up +1562% since [January 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/).  This is still well behind first place **ETH** (2,300%) but much better than the rest of the Top Ten cryptos, including second place **Bitcoin** (+1172%).  And the total market is performing much better than the Top Ten approach (+510%).

Translation: unless you picked **ETH** correctly thirty-three months ago, you were better off diversifying. And the Top Ten approach has beaten every individual crypto except **BTC** and **ETH**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-one/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.22T** [**last month**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-32/).

## Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/ehegw9buqmt71.png?width=472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=742d0bff8e8ce113e53eb137186ebcd53806b94b

**BitDom** bounced slightly in September, up to 43.2% compared to 42% in August.  This is the low end of the range when looking at the timeframe as a whole.  For context, here are the high and low points of **BTC** domination over the life of the 2019 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**41.9% in May 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-29).

High Point in the 2019 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-ten-month-eight/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2019:

https://preview.redd.it/ti8hhr6wqmt71.png?width=355&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b2b4aed6ccf4093e3f235d8448e232d9ca062a1

The 2019 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio lost $748 in September.  After thirty-three months the value of the initial $1000 investment is **$6,098**, up +510%.  

Below is a table summarizing the monthly ROI over the life of the 2019 Top Ten Index Fund experiments, providing a pretty good sense of the journey up to this point:

https://preview.redd.it/i0e9q6qxqmt71.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b94e138f7ac17cb20a08eb5f3485b246f4c5ac73

Fairly steady upward movements punctuated by massive dips.  During the [Zombie Apocalypse](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-15/), for example, the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio was returning only +6%. 

Although the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio is up an impressive +510%, it is still a distant second place behind the [2020 Top Ten Portfolio ](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-20)which is up +731%.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Speaking of other Top Ten Portfolios, let’s put them all together now:

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +46% (total value $1,460)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-33): up +510% (total value $6,098)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-21): up +731% (total value $8,309)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9): up +333% (total value $4,330)

Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,197** ($1,460 + $6,098 + $8,309 + $4,330).

**That’s up +405%** on the combined portfolio. Below is a table to help visualize the progress of the Experiment as a whole:

https://preview.redd.it/a66gy6bzqmt71.png?width=568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7888136e54b0bb51c4e9008142bcb2be6b1de6d0

In summary: ***That’s an +405% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st for four straight years***.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of the experiments to have a comparison point with traditional markets.   ***For the first time in nearly a year, the S&amp;P 500 did not reach a month end all time high***:

https://preview.redd.it/nch41r70rmt71.png?width=542&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d53979f98a0177ee80907409c14fdf1b0268b78

Because the S&amp;P 500 Index is up 74% since January 2019, the initial $1k investment I put into crypto thirty-three months ago would be worth $1,740 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500 in January 2019. 

Even though an extremely solid return for traditional markets, that +74% return is *four hundred and thirty-six percentage points behind* the return of the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio over the same time period.

But what if I took the same world’s-slowest-dollar-cost-averaging $1,000-per-year-on-January-1st-Crypto-Index-Fund-Experiment approach with the S&amp;P 500? It would yield the following:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,630 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,740 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,350 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,160 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,880** ($1,630 + $1,740 + $1,350 + $1,160)

That is up **+47%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+405%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of over nearly 360 percentage points ***in favor of crypto.***

Here’s a table providing an overview of the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&amp;P: 

https://preview.redd.it/7z0vgw32rmt71.jpg?width=598&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66a64430ef6252d4dd3c9c87b2ab4bc340118b68

## Conclusion:

September was bumpy in crypto to say the least, but it was also a rough month for traditional markets. Although a down month for the 2019 Top Ten Portfolio, the zoomed out picture clearly shows crypto is in control and is clearly providing much better ROI than traditional markets.  

To both old-timers and newcomers: thanks so much for taking the time to read and for supporting the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments. I hope you find the updates helpful in terms of perspective as you navigate the crypto landscape.  Be careful out there and don’t put your mental, physical, or financial health at risk chasing gainz. If crypto is causing you to lose sleep at night, chances are you have too much in crypto: try to think long term and don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.

I currently buy on Coinbase Pro but the 0.5% trading fee is starting to feel like too much. I was thinking of buying on Kraken since their taker fees are 0.26%, but they have withdrawal fees on top of trading fees.

Greetings, fellow investors. I'm writing this analysis as a friendly heads-up as to what might happen with the crypto market in the near future and **why you shouldn't worry**.

Currently, we're experiencing stable growth in BTC price and Ethereum is at times outperforming BTC, marking a tendency we usually see some time before Altcoin Season starts, which is a great sign.

However, there's a pretty big possibility we might see another small crash soon, and here are the 3 reasons why this **might** happen:

1. The U.S Securities and Exchange Commission is set to approve the use of Bitcoin ETFs. This is amazing news for the crypto market, as **institutions and corporations** would have a regulated way to indirectly invest in Bitcoin (keep in mind, this is not the same as simply buying straight BTC), which would open a **huge** figurative floodgate, from which new money can flood the market **long-term**. However, the same may not apply in the short term. There's a Wall St. saying - ""Buy the Rumor, Sell the News"". If you're not familiar with it, it basically means ""Buy the hype and then sell just when the event happens"". A recent example of this is when Musk appeared on SNL to shill Dogecoin and the price soared just before the event but ended up tanking afterward. It's very likely that we may see the exact same scenario happen now. The media is hyping the ETFs, the price is soaring and we might see a steep drop when it actually happens. Of course, this drop would only be **temporary**, just like all the others but it's nice to know what might cause it, as to **not despair** and see it as a mere **buying opportunity**.
2. Some of the top BTC whales are selling amounts shy of 80\~ million USD. While some of them might be simply cashing out on their profits, **some of these whales have a history of selling just before the market crashes**. It's possible they themselves are trying to sell just before the ETF hits, so they can buy back in later at a lower price and increase their holdings. While this is **not a 100% sure indicator** of a market crash, it's nice to know it's happening, so you can anticipate the possibility of a crash.

This post is meant to provide you with information, so you can draw your own subjective opinions. It is merely advice to not despair, but to rather see the situation as a **possible opportunity to fill your bag before the market finally pumps**.

1092,CryptoCurrency,inevitable_username,"You probably know the definition of these abbreviations. 

What I'd like to focus your attention is the actual examples on how LP-aggregator platform are trick you using the difference between these.

To be clear, let's define ROI, APR and APY as they are used in the cryptosphere. 

**ROI – return on investment, overall.** Since the initial investment is usually fiat currency, it is generally calculated in fiat, but can be calculated in anything – we'll stick to USD. 

*ROI = (Current Value of Investment − Cost of Investment) ​ ​/  Cost of Investment* 

\**multiply by 100 to get the result in %*

e.g.1 Alice bought a certain coin at $46 in the May 2021 crash and sold it yesterday at the price of $1,000. To calculate the return on this investment, divide the net profits ($1,000 - $46 = $956) by the investment cost ($46), for a ROI of 2073.9%.

e.g.2 Bob bought a certain coin at $1,000 in Jan 2018 and sold it in the May 2021 crash at the price of $46. To calculate the return on this investment, divide the net profits ($46 - $1,000 = -$956) by the investment cost ($1,000), for a ROI of -95.4%.

Let's complicate it further. Both Alice and Bob staked that certain coin for their entire period they held it at a flat rate of 80% per year (APR 80%).

In these 5 month, Alice earned 0.333 of that coin in staking rewards. Bob earned 1.96 of that coin in 44.5 months. What changes now is the first variable (Current Value of Investment). So when they sold, Alice had 1.333 coin, Bob had 2.96 of that coin.

Alice's ROI \[(1,333 - 46) / 46\] is 2797%.

Bob's ROI \[136 - 1,000) / 1000\] is -$86.4%.

SITYMI® (Stake it till you make it!)

**As you can see, ROI has no time frame. So, when you speak of ROI, you need to additionally specify the time period. ROI includes everything: staking rewards, the increase/decrease in price of the underlying asset, fees and taxes (yeah, I skipped those for simplicity, just deduce them).**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**APR – an estimated annual percentage rate,** an estimation of how many percent a year you will earn or have to pay (in case it's a loan). In LP farming APR can mean two things: the percentage your pooled coins are estimated to grow in a year based on some previous metrics, or LP farming rewards in percent a year over the dollar value of your pooled investment.

e.g.1 Bob staked 1,000 USDC at 8.88% APR for 12 days. He got 1,002.9 USDC back.

To adjust APR to a different number of months, divide APR by 12 and multiply by the desired number of months.  

To adjust APR to a different number of days, divide APR by 365 and multiply by the desired number of days.  

e.g.2 Alice decided to provide liquidity in the BUSD-BNB pool on Pancakeswap for the APR of 34.35% paid in CAKE. She threw in $400 and expects to accumulate CAKE for the dollar value of around $137 within a year.

**APR has ""annual"" in it, so it's tied to a year.**   

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**APY – annual percentage yield, APR + compounding interest.** Compounding = when your interest is added to your initial investment and they continue delivering interest together.

Now this is where it gets really shady. There are at least 3 variables that need to be defined for an accurate calculation – is compounding manual or automatic? If automatic, then how often is the interest compounded? The duration is absolutely crucial here!

Here is a great tool to play around with these variables and see how drastically they affect the estimated return.

[www.aprtoapy.com/](https://www.aprtoapy.com/)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**So now let's get to tricks platforms and exchanges use specifically to mislead you and pitfalls that come from misunderstanding these indices.**

1) The platform gives you estimated ROI. Technically they are correct – they consider your coins an initial investment and estimate the return from there. But someone who doesn't see the difference may see a 4,000% ROI pool on a coin and think: ""so if I *invest* $1,000 (buy this coin and stake it in this pool), I can expect 4,000% *return* on my *investment...* that's like 11 grand or something."" But in fact, by the end of the year, this individual will have 4,000% more of that coin and God knows how much that bag is going to be worth.

2) Psychological trick. APR gives you a yearly estimation, but sometimes it can vary if the platform decides so. Or in the case of LP farms – APR may (and will likely) drop as more money is injected into the farm. So you may be looking at 80% APR that will turn into 40% APR in a week and settle at 20% APR in a month. Farms even close occasionally – it means your coin are not earning anything (besides a portion of liquidity fees) and just sitting there, waiting for you to withdraw.   

3) Some platforms show attractive APY's but are less vocal about the fact that you'll have to compound manually with a specific frequency to each that APY. Of course, you can claim rewards and add them as frequent as you choose, but if its a DEX, you'll have to pay network fees twice for every time you compound your interest manually.     

4) APY. Bob sees a handsome APY of 9,000% and thinks: ""9,000% APY / 365 days is 24,6%. So my investment will be earning 24,6% a day, 1% an hour! If I throw in like $1,000, that's like $10 an hour!!! I'm quitting my job!"" 

But after 60 minutes of F5-ing that crazy farm, Bob only earned a fraction of what he expected.  

You see where Bob's wrong, right? APY of 9,000% is APR of *just* 453.88% compounded daily. You'd have to keep the investment in for the whole year (and never withdraw interest) to allow it to compound the designed number of times and reach the estimated 9,000%. And again, it remains uncertain how much that coin will be worth.

I'm sure there's a bunch of other tricks and pitfalls, but these are the most common ones that come to mind.

While checking VET I found that it is trading in ranges, the coin has a smaller price however those movements have an amazing return.

As you can see the price is bouncing back and forth on these prices. More experienced trader will wait for the price to hit the resistance, check the MACD and Volume and if possible use Fibonacci to buy if favorable. Buying on these pressure points is the best choice to avoid risk and enjoy a faster initial moving.   
Reading the current movement we can see that the Volume is a little weaker, however the price is feeling the last resistance, buyer are fighting hard the sellers and the MACD is about to change to buyer, risk operation, many would wait for a break on the resistance and a pull back. Those who are better at trading could enjoy big gains aiming 20% or more gain while operating those congestion regions.

For those Holding, it seems that the price is picking up a newer bullish movement and could soon break those resistances seeking the last top. The BTC bullish movement is helping to inject more liquidity on these smaller coins, however this one is still a little shy for a stronger buyer movement.

1140,CryptoCurrency,ballarak,"Wanted to share some thoughts on the implications of Putin pushing for crypto and hopefully get some insight from you all as well.

First, the context:
&gt; Cryptocurrency “has the right to exist and can be used as a means of payment,” Putin said in an interview with CNBC that was posted on the Kremlin’s website Thursday. Still, he cautioned it was too soon to talk about using digital currencies for trading oil and other commodities that form the bulk of Russia’s exports. -[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/putin-defends-cryptocurrencies-amid-global-regulation-push)

Initially this news seems bullish, it's yet another country that seems to be embracing crypto. Russia is one of the world's largest markets, and one of the world's largest internet user bases at 85% internet penetration, meaning that its population seems ripe for crypto growth. 

However, in the wider geopolitical context, one could view this as an attempt by Putin to weaken the power of US economic sanctions. Also from the Bloomberg article:
&gt; Russia has sought alternatives to trading in dollars since being slapped with sanctions in 2014 following the annexation of Crimea, and Putin accuses the U.S. of using its currency as a weapon.

Russia wouldn't be the only country under the threat of US sanctions that have used Crypto to lessen the impact of US economic sanctions. Iran is known to use Bitcoin mining as a way to generate revenue despite sanctions and even incentivized miners to setup operations in Iran by providing cheap electricity ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/iran-uses-crypto-mining-lessen-impact-sanctions-study-finds-2021-05-21/)). North Korea also uses crypto to evade sanctions, and an Ethereum Foundation researcher was even arrested in 2019 for allegedly helping North Korea deploy blockchain technology ([Business Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/virgil-griffith-ethereum-north-korea-crypto-sanctions-vitalik-buterin-foundation-2021-09)).

From the US's perspective, wider crypto adoption runs the risk of undermining US economic leverage and removing the ability to use sanctions as a credible threat. If you think about it,  future is even inherent in crypto's narrative as sounder, more salable money. It seems likely that the US will look for ways to weakening crypto's ability to be used for sanctions evasion.

1171,CryptoCurrency,Maxflipper,"TLDR: I lost 3 million dollars in BTC and made a secure crypto wallet with no seed phrase 

So in late 2009, I was in college studying engineering and a friend told me about Bitcoin and I thought I had already missed the boat, but I decided to mine it anyway following the news of its development.

After mining on my laptop for an afternoon I managed to get about 50 BTC. I completely forgot about it and a few years later when more and more people started to talk about Bitcoin I thought what happened to the Bitcoin I used to mine? 

So I started to look for my private keys everywhere! I checked emails, documents and searched temporary files But in the end I wasn’t able to find it and today it’d be worth about $3 million dollars.

Over the years I became more and more interested in Ethereum and was in love with the way that it was programmable. If Bitcoin was Gold 2.0 then Ethereum was the internet 2.0 and I knew where I wanted to be.

However, it wasn't until I started telling my story to friends and family who were interested in crypto that I found out that getting hacked, losing seed phrases and private keys was a common occurrence. So I wanted to do something about it. 

I thought that there was a better way to store crypto so decided to build a wallet that split the private keys between your friends and family which means it wouldn’t matter if you lost your device and makes being hacked nearly impossible.",My $3 million dollar mistake inspired me to create a secure wallet,1634224549

Having ""kind of"" known about Bitcoin myself back in 2012, but not thinking much of it and moving on. I only seriously started exploring crypto at the tail end of 2017. Oh boy.  I thought things were nuts back then with the way the market was, but that is really nothing compared to how things are now. Especially if you just look at your average social medium. Having witnessed some TikTok's videos spread around of people claiming Shiba Inu can go to $1 easily has pretty much made me lose hope in humanity in some way. When things seem too good to be true, they usually are. It's a phrase that has been done to death, but it still holds true.

People, please use common sense. Whenever the red signs are there to be seen, simply by taking time and think for a moment.. Of course there will be people who jump in early on some crazy meme thing going sky high and gaining profit. But don't take it too seriously, if you're lucky just get the hell out when you can. Do not throw in your life savings, do not go crazy on it.

A lot of people that joined the crypto world know very little about crypto in general, even the basic things. Even I admit openly that many projects out there are far out there for me on the technical scale.  But  I try to learn more each day; you don't have to know everyting. But with due dilligence it is still possible to make out a fantasy from a serious and legit project. Don't take something for true because xx of people tell you this. It's ok not to know everything, as Dirty Harry once said in one of the movies: ***""A man's got to know his limitations"".***

Knowing what you know and don't know is winning half the battle. Make your own decisions based on logic and reasoning and not on fear of missing out on some crazy pump people claim to know about.

**If you happen to stumble on this and you are one of the beginners in the cryptoworld, start reading or looking at the very basic core of the cryptoworld: the blockchain, the core that most crypto projects are based on (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, but not all). Learn what a blockchain is and for what purpose it is used and to solve which problems. After that you can get a better grasp on the usage of some projects and what they try to solve.**

1187,CryptoCurrency,blothhundrr,"Fellow Algonauts, Governance is upon us, with less than an hour to go to commit. The market is on a rally right now, but ALGO, although up, is still a little slow catching up to the likes of DOT and ETH. It's still a good time to increase your position and commit even more to governance. If you've been an Algonaut for even a month, you probably know all about governance and why it could be great for you. 

For everyone else, let me explain in the simplest of terms.

Governance is Algorands approach to decentralization. Over the course of the next 12 months, ALGO holders will be eligible to 4 periods of voting, or governance, by committing, and maintaining said committed amount, to governance. During each period, Algorand will put forth a referendum that ALGO holders can vote on. 1 ALGO = 1 vote. 

What do you get in return for committing your coins? Higher rate of return on your ALGO rewards. 
During each governance period, depending on the total amount of ALGO committed, Algonauts can earn between 18-30% APY, including the 5-6% you already get just for holding ALGO. 

When you commit to governance, you are still in complete ownership of your ALGO, which will remain in your wallet. 

The only catch is that if the amount of ALGO in your wallet drops below the committed amount, you miss our on the extra rewards you would have otherwise gotten on top of your regular 5-6% APY.
So essentially you're not locking in your ALGO.

You can participate through any wallet, but best and most convenient to do it through MyAlgo or Algorand Wallet, both of which take only a couple of minutes to set up. And committing takes another minute at most on top. 

You have 40 minutes to decide if you're in or out. If you're worried that isn't enough time to read up and familiarize yourself, I'd suggest to still go ahead, as you can opt out anytime after reading up on this and concluding this isn't for you, without any loss whatsoever.

Really, there is absolutely no risk in this. 

Anyway, this isn't me shilling ALGO or whatever I'm.sure some people will claim. Just spreading some awareness for those out of the loop.

1189,CryptoCurrency,darwinlovestrees,"I'm sure lots of people here are familiar with the [Bitcoin Rainbow Chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/) (a logarithmic chart of the price of Bitcoin), but just in case, I'm here to give y'all a big heaping helping of hopium today.

Here's a shot of the Rainbow Chart as it is today:

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin Rainbow Chart. A logarithmic scale of the price of Bitcoin, showing the halving events.](https://preview.redd.it/8lwlwr1wmft71.png?width=1824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a8b09c4f77483397fa460bbe5546113a48aab68)

In 2017, the price of Bitcoin peaked at the end of the year (mid-December) around $19k. This was following a massive, lightning-fast bullrun that is now the stuff of legend around here. The FOMO of that year has made many of us crypto enthusiasts who we are, quite honestly.

Here is that peak highlighted on the Rainbow chart:

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin's peak in December 2017. Not quite halfway between halvings.](https://preview.redd.it/uhjavwn2nft71.png?width=1826&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c7aa1e9e61e1ae8ef45ccc61e72231a9c81069a)

&amp;#x200B;

But let's back up a little. Where was Bitcoin in, say, mid-October of 2017?

&amp;#x200B;

[The price of Bitcoin on October 12, 2017 was $5,600.](https://preview.redd.it/ek1mkudbnft71.png?width=1823&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f129b3f918c9843c52efd174e30b8669055e9cf4)

&amp;#x200B;

This means that from mid-October to mid-December of 2017, Bitcoin skyrocketed from $5,600 to over $19,000. That's a growth of 343% in 3 months. That's a fucking rocket if I've ever seen one.

Now, let's extrapolate.

Ignoring for a moment the sheer amount of money that would be required to be injected into Bitcoin in order to move the price this much, let's just speculate for a second.

If Bitcoin followed the same trajectory from now until mid-December that it did during the same period in 2017, it will be...

&amp;#x200B;

[One hundred and eighty one god damn thousand dollars.](https://preview.redd.it/w3g91dcznft71.png?width=1823&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe536faf49a4156c0532d91adfbaa22a6a746e2c)

That's right. Let that sink in.

You don't even need the comforting colors of the rainbow to tell you this. Bitcoin's price today ($57,600) plus a growth of 343%, is even higher than that estimate, at **$197,500.**

The reason this has become eerily predictable is because of the halvings. If you don't know what a Bitcoin halving event is, [you can read more about it here](https://coinmarketcap.com/halving/bitcoin/).

Now, of course, this means a tripled marketcap as well. Can the marketcap for Bitcoin really reach $3 trillion? Depends on who you ask. Myself and many others believe that is likely still small peanuts when we're talking about a global digital currency being adopted in increasing measure around the world. We're still pretty early.

I'm curious as to others thoughts on this sub about the benefits of micro dosing psychedelics like psilocybin, lsd, and hell even DMT and if or how it has affected your thoughts, views, or the projects you invest in.

I think the two subjects are more closely related than it first appears, at least in my experience. They are both counter culture and both are currently up ending the norms of modern day society. For many the main goal of micro dosing is to increase productivity or see or feel something new. Or help with anxiety or depression. While all of those things can and will start happening the other thing that can start happening is more like an awakening. An awakening to the lies and fallacies of our society. You start to see things for what they are and realize it's all kind of a game. Especially money. 

Once you start to really be able to see all of the obstacles that are set in place by society/gov to literally keep you in your place, if your like me you start to look for an out. Which led me to crypto.

 I felt trapped, like there was no way an average person could break free from the ""work till you die"" model. Then I learned about decentralized finance, and other platforms offering huge daily compounding interest rates on crypto and stable coins. I took a chance and pulled out a chunk from a 401k. Ironically the only reason I was ""allowed"" to pull my own money was because of covid the temporary law change that allowed citizens to pull from a retirement account if impacted by COVID. Best decision ever.

Downside: they're the 2nd largest exchange and would lead to more centralization in the market. The SEC recently refused to allow CB to offer higher interest rates on USDC. Are further restrictions coming for USDC as banks feel crypto squeezing their profits?

Then there's Binance. Currently the largest exchange and 2nd largest stablecoin, BUSD also claims to have 1:1 backed USD in FDIC issued banks. Binance claims to have third-party and NYDFS audits performed quarterly for compliance.

Downside: Same as CB. They're already the largest exchange, and would further centralize the marketplace. Binance is also currently under investigation by the UK and the SEC for money laundering and tax evasion. Would we be replacing Tether with another house of cards?

1196,CryptoCurrency,IlseWasden," Any anonymous transaction can be used to commit criminal activities, privacy is still a basic human right, which shields citizens from government intervention into their life and an essential component for human freedom.  
Due to the increasing nature of pervasive techniques used by governments as well as corporations to unmask user privacy of citizens, it is crucial for general users to preserve the privacy and security of their personal information. Snowden revelations gave us an important lesson and made us understand the importance of privacy.  
For example a user who lives in a country where LGBTQ rights are notrespected can donate to a country or organization which supports LGBTQ rights without revealing his name or address and still live safely in his own country without any fear if he is using an anonymous transaction.  
By default all transactions made on all public blockchains are pseudonym in nature which means you can see the wallet a transaction is made but don't know who is the owner of that wallet.

All transactions made on all blockchain is transparent and visible to the public from anywhere in the world with an internet connection.  
Blockchain explorers will publish all transaction details.  
Even though this is the case there are some platforms where you can make anonymous and pseudonymous transactions on the public blockchains. SmashCash platform is one of the first private untraceable platform where users can make private and anonymous transactions. They claim the platform enable transactions which both are untraceable and unlinkable.  
SmashCash also makes the transaction unlinkeable which means a beholder cannot tell the relationship between an originated wallet and destination wallet.  
SmasahCash uses a technology called zK-Snarks short form for zero knowledge succing and non interactive arguments of knowledge.  
Zm-snarks is a pretty complicated algorithm as its name sounds like. But for our purpose just know that zk-snark enable one user to send or prove that a statement is true without revealing anything specific about the statement or the person revealing it which is the best solution in crypto to make transactions unlikeable.

  
**Tor Browser and VPN for Staying anonymous.**  
A user can make a transaction even more secure and private by using services like Tor browser and VPN. These two services are designed to protect the users from revealing their identity and maintain their anonymity. Journalists and researchers have used this technique for a long time to maintain their privacy and security. Now cryptocurrency users use this to maintain their privacy.

Both Tor and VPN are free but to get a better service its better to pay for paid VPN services. Tor and VPN work on similar principles by hiding the IP address of the user and use different IP addresses for each session.  
VPN and Tor prevents hackers or attackers from monitoring the traffic coming from a particular IP and hiding the transactions of a particular user.  
Now a new platform SmashCash enables users to hide their transactions and help them make private and anonymous transactions on 10 different blockchains.

For better understanding have a look at the comparison given below.

1241,CryptoCurrency,RefugeeDutch_Syrian,"Central America, South America and bitcoin, it seems to be becoming a golden combination. It all started with El Salvador, of course, and now there are also positive sounds coming from Venezuela regarding the adoption of bitcoin. A major international airport in the country is about to accept payments with bitcoin for airline tickets and other services.

&amp;#x200B;

""We need to continue to evolve in this new economic reality and the technology that comes with it to remain accessible,"" said Freddy Borges, the director of Simón Bolívar International Airport to news platform El Siglo. It does not stop at accepting bitcoin, however, the director reveals [in the interview](https://elsiglo.com.ve/2021/10/09/freddy-borges-director-del-aeropuerto-internacional-de-maiquetia/).

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin will not be the only digital currency with which you will soon be able to buy your airline tickets at Simón Bolívar. The plan is to also integrate Dash and the Venezuelan Petro, the currency linked to oil, into the airport's services. According to the airport's director, accepting crypto has positive implications for foreign tourists, including those from Russia.

&amp;#x200B;

The news from Venezuela comes at a time when the country is also experimenting with digital central bank money. In fact, the Venezuelan bolivar digital currency was launched on October 1 of this year. So what the authorities in the country think of this move by the airport remains to be seen. Leaders in countries like this are generally not fans of competition, although El Salvador is perhaps a good example that bitcoin can also offer a country a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, it is an interesting development and it seems that paying with bitcoin is slowly but surely becoming a reality across the continent. When you see how quickly companies like Mc Donald's, Starbucks and, for example, Walmart have managed to accept bitcoin in El Salvador, it certainly offers hope for the future.",Bitcoin as a means of payment at Venezuela's international airport,1634137147

For example, let’s be super original and analyze SHIB. Current price is averaging $0.000028 per coin. For it to reach the infamous 1¢, you adjust the sliders on the website for marketcap and volume of circulating supply and **voila** you have what conditions you’d need to achieve said amount. 

For this adventure, I chose to “burn” most of it so that the marketcap would stay closer to the lower top 10 coins. 

BUT you’d need to burn over 90% of the supply while boosting the market cap over 10x. 

Even if it didn’t burn any of the coins, but had Bitcoin’s market cap of $1 trillion, it would still only be worth $0.0027, a lot more than it is now but still shy of 1¢.

1263,CryptoCurrency,DearOldNinja,"I'd like to discuss some ideas for anyone who is very new to crypto or just thinking about it. I always try to find different ways to show people that entering the crypto world isn't as scary or difficult as it sounds. In fact in some cases you don't even need to have money to own crypto. I've owned crypto since 2017. I have missed every damn trip to the moon by either not investing enough or not dedicating enough time to learn and stay ahead. Don't be discouraged because others are seeing huge returns. We are still early and have time to get in! 

You should work with crypto to your benefit and create multiple ways to experience growth. I want to list a few of the methods that I've relied on but would encourage anyone reading to share their methods. I'd love to hear about everything that I don't know and that's quite a lot.

Always keep an eye out for free crypto! Some apps offer free crypto in exchange for interaction. Coinbase offers small quizzes that allows you to earn coins. You only need to meet their eligibility requirements with the likely biggest challenge being the country criteria. Completing the quizzes gave me $32 USD worth of coins in about 10 minutes of being on the app. 

A coin that you can gather freely is BAT. Download the Brave browser and use it. Thats all! While you browse you earn BAT. Its slow and you wont get rich but that BAT coin can be converted to other coins. You're going to browse the net anyway right? Your computer will be on anyway right? Remember that saving can be done a little at a time and this is an opportunity that just doesn't make sense to say no to. 

Don't ignore sign up bonus links. Ask your spouse or eligible children to sign up! Even if they have zero interest in crypto or managing it you can always just collect the coins. Ask a friend or family member, youtubers have them, or you can even google them. It costs nothing to open an account and this is an important idea to keep in mind because you can gather decent bonuses from different apps. It is true that these links come with their own eligibility criteria and that must be met for you to receive your sign up bonus. Do what you can to follow through to open accounts and receive the rewards. Crypto is easy to move around  and if you already own coins there is a good chance you can meet the requirements without too much wallet pain. Get creative with how you buy and move crypto because there are lots of benefits to learning how fluid these coins can be and how easily you can move from exchange to exchange to wallet and so on. 

If you have managed to get your self in some decent investments and those investments are going to be long term than its worth finding programs that either allow you to stake or an app that gives you a nice percentage return. Algorand is currently near the end of their governance period so if you want to see people preparing for the ""staking period"" you can see it in real time on their sub. Voyager offers some decent returns for parking coins with them and you'll probably see plenty of apps that offer some kind of reward. With some basic organization you can park coins where they will offer the most return. Treat them individually rather than ""my whole crypto portfolio is in one location because I like the bigger numbers"". Finally,  remember that with staking  programs you are promising your coins for a period of time. You'll want to know if you can pull the coins and what effect that might have on your rewards. The return should be worthwhile for **YOU** but keep in mind that if your crypto is going to sit out there anyway as opposed to storage then it might as well be somewhere that earns you more crypto or money or just more of whatever rewards make you happy.",Lets talk about the methods we use to get a little more crypto.

Being new to this world, I am sorry if the questions are dumb. 

Please let me know whether the below my understandings are correct or not.

2. I think, the exchange will act as validator with our staked coins? - is this statement correct?
3. Slashing refers if a validator makes a mistake while building a block. There will be some penalty from the coin they staked. - Is this statement correct? 
4. And what will happen if there is any slashing happens? will that affect the investors who have staked their coin through exchange?
5. Coin is a protocol where as Token is developed on top of a protocol. Is this statement correct?
6. Miners are for PoW and Validators are for PoW? is this statement correct?

The web browser from Brave Software relies on an unusual business model, it strips out ads from websites, replaces them with its own ads, then allows users to earn BAT for just viewing the add.


Brave fights malware and prevents tracking, keeping your information safe and secure! Unlike Google! 


Their servers neither see nor store your browsing data – it stays private, on your devices, until you delete it. Which means they won’t ever sell your data to third parties!

I've seen many people blame others for their losses. They blame Coin Bureau, another YouTuber, someone on Twitter, a family member etc. But if they **gain** money, it's all because **they** are the genius.

Unless someone forced you to buy a certain coin, it was your fault. And you can recover from any loss you made, as long as you keep leaning and improving.

Even if someone on Reddit makes a very long, convincing post and they end it with: This is financial advice, it's still your fault if you buy that coin and lose.

# What is it?

Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a blockchain that originated thanks to the application of an Ethereum community sponsored hard fork. This hard fork was created in order to solve a difficult situation that the community has gone through, linked to the theft of several million ethers in 2016 and which were protected by the project, The DAO. The application of this hard fork divided the Ethereum community among those who supported and deducted it.  However, the majority approved its execution, which ended up splitting Ethereum into two blockchains. One where the stolen funds were returned to the owners, and which is now known as Ethereum. The other, the original blockchain where stolen funds have not been removed and where history has simply run its course. The latter blockchain ended up receiving the name Ethereum Classic.  But despite the differences that exist between the principles of both projects, they aim for the same purpose: to become a powerful decentralized blockchain platform, platforms capable of executing Smart Contracts, without any possibility of third party interference, censorship, inactivity or fraud.  To achieve this, Ethereum Classic bases much of its technology on what is inherited from Ethereum, but also builds its own. All this under a community and open development, respecting the philosophical guidelines of the community.

# How does it work?

Ater Ethereum Classic creation, its community organized itself to lay the foundations of its functioning and its principles. Being a fully decentralized and community-driven project, Ethereum Classic had great organizational challenges. However, in a short time his community was able to specify everything related to its functioning and the rules of the community.  Among these rules we can highlight:

* **Immutability first of all: t**he Ethereum Classic community believes that the main value proposition of any blockchain is immutability. This means that valid transactions can never be canceled or forgotten. Individuals interacting in Ethereum Classic are governed by this reality and the phrase: ""*The code is the law principle*.""  This means that the code with which users voluntarily interact will govern those interactions at all times. Nothing and no one within Ethereum Classic can do anything to change it.  This was created with the purpose of avoiding situations such as those that occurred in DAO and the hard fork that led to the creation of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.
* **Decentralized governance**: another point that the Ethereum Classic community wants is that decentralized governance is respected at all times. His vision in this regard is that only decentralization can guarantee the life of the project beyond time. Furthermore, they indicate that decentralization avoids cases such as corruption, irresponsibility, nepotism, inefficiency and stagnation. Therefore, Ethereum Classic manifests these values ​​by relinquishing control for a formalized central base. The only hierarchy is that of transparent meritocracy and mutual reputation.  At this point, the Ethereum Classic community is very clear: Third party interventions are not allowed. Decisions are made by the community for the benefit of the community. This point makes a big difference with Ethereum, where third parties have interfered openly or not in decisions.

Ethereum Classic has a lot of technology inherited and carried over from Ethereum. Both projects are very similar and to some extent have a compatible code base.  For example, its consensus protocol is Proof of Work (PoW) using the Etash algorithm. It also has, like Ethereum, the ability to use EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). This means that Ethereum Classic can implement smart contracts, DApps and enjoy all its possibilities. In addition to this, it also has the ability to issue tokens compatible with Ethereum's ERC-20 standard (a utility that allows you to create a complex economic system to support ETC DApps).  But there are other marked differences between the two projects. One of them is the currency issue limit. In Ethereum Classic, the maximum issuance is 230 million, but in Ethereum this is infinite. Another different point is the handling of mining rewards, which is highest in Ethereum Classic, reaching 4 Ethers per block.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallets for ETC are MyEtherWallet, MetaMark, Trust Wallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. Completely decentralized governance
2. Great community around ETC project
3. There is a complete and precise roadmap

**Cons**

1. Devs team is not one of the best
2. Ethereum Classic will be even more vulnerable to 51% attacks like the ones they have already suffered",KnowYourCrypto #33 - Ethereum Classic (ETC),1634053166

I was robbed. Someone was able to steal all my XRP from Uphold (even with 2FA). Now, I know about link scams... transfer scans... sim hacks... key loggers... I was not dumb enough to click or send anything to anyone with the expectation of doubling my money. But I must be dumb in some area because I do not know how this is possible.

The ""hacker"" was able to get into my uphold account, change my email, bypass 2FA, convert my xrp to eth, and move all my coins off my exchange... all without my knowledge or 2FA permissions. You can see the transactions below:

1406,CryptoCurrency,Mettez,"I'm still fairly new in terms of investing in crypto, and I'm learning as much as possible. How do you guys handle when your portfolio becomes 'out-of-balance' in terms of spread of investments?

For example, when one or more coins that are not BTC or ETH pumps in your portfolio, do you move the profits over to (one of) those two coins? This scenario assumes that you want to keep your entire investment as is (and not yet take profits out of crypto).

Let's make this very practical. Let's say you are investing fairly 'risky', and you divided your total investment like this when you started out:  
30% BTC  
30% ETH  
15% ADA  
10% SOL  
10% ONE  
5% spread out amongst various smaller alt-coins  


However, after a while, some coins pumped, some didn't, and now the division looks like this:  
20% BTC  
20% ETH  
20% ADA  
15% SOL  
15% ONE  
10% various smaller alt-coins  


How would you handle this example? Also, these coins mentioned are just examples, it's more about the general idea than the specific coins. Do you rebalance? Do you keep the original investment? Do the changes need to be bigger before you rebalance? How would you handle this example:  


15% BTC  
15% ETH  
20% ADA  
20% SOL  
20% ONE

I'm a disabled person coming from a poor family and I figured that I have worse than bad chances on the job market. I'm not dumb or at least I hope so and at first, I assumed crypto would just be a trend. But it obviously is not. It's here to stay. 

Sadly I live in Germany so I am required to give every crypto wallet literally all of my personal information so the state can do it's 100% surveillance. Classic. 

Anyways, what I am curious about is the privacy of bitcoin wallets. If I do transactions, will other people see all of my personal information like with a bank transfer or Paypal?

In my journey of trying to find other ways of earning crypto (other than earning fait the old fashioned way), i came across the beermoney subreddit, and through them i found websites like swagbucks or [freecash](https://freecash.com/r/19ff420e9c) where you do tasks to earn money. Some of these tasks can be playing mobile games, that although are still not amazing, are ahead of cypto games. The nice thing about free cash is you are then able to withdraw your rewards to coinbase as btc or eth. In September i earned about 300$ usd, just playing various mobile apps. Which is much more then the two months i spent wandering around trying to collect vaults in coinhunt world.

It was surprising to hear her talk about crypto, as usually she is a down to earth person who had gone through a lot in her life, I remember her bad divorce from few years ago and that episode really affected her, and she had to be checked into rehab. Anyways, she managed to pick herself up and today all of us teachers look up to her as someone who managed to chase away the ghosts of her past and build a great career 

Anyways, while we were having breakfast she just came into the break out room and started talking about crypto, and how one of her students became a billionaire just by holding crypto. Apparently this kid did a school presentation on crypto back in 2015, when it was worth nothing, and at that time no one paid attention to him, and now he has made a billion dollars out of it, drives fancy cars and is quite the big shot now. She felt that she missed a great opportunity at by not listening to the kid, and said she is now considering investing in few dog coins. 

Hearing the story, all of the other teachers seemed very interested and couple of them were discussing on how to get started with crypto. 

Anyhoo... just wanted to share this random story of how crypto adoption is spreading even in teacher's break out rooms.

How this happened? He emailed himself both his 12-word phrase and his wallet password (this last to GMail and Hotmail), so anyone with access to his PC could have free access to that information. No need of 2FA, since the wallet only needs the password to confirm a transfer or the phrase to recover it from another device.

He also told me that his Facebook warned him about an unknown access attempt. I told him to log out of all devices, change his passwords and don't spread sensitive information via email.

I know the only person to blame is him. That way of storing passwords was super reckless. I don't want to give him false expectations. For me, that money is gone. But, I read some posts that people have recovered their coins somehow?

1. Family members and very close friends - not telling them is not about trust, it's about them knowing about your financial profile and possibly wanting you to lend them some money or change their opinion in general about you. Knowing about your extra income might make them suspicious due to the fact that many people still associate Crypto with shady activities. 
2. Friends, associates and colleagues - pretty much the same reasons as above but the trust factor have a main role here. In this circle the chances of you being scammed, conned or misled by some of these people is higher.

I made a post last week of why this is a good thing for the market. In short, **all the attention right now is on BTC surpassing its ATH**, which when achieved would make a very bullish case for the bull run.

So when will your alts move? I don't know. I personally think this can go on for months, at least until after BTC reclaims ATH and stabilizes. The last time a similar scenario happened was from Oct 2020 to Jan 2021. That took 4 months.

Most of the money that I had cashed out, I put it into a coin called Dogecoin that was barely worth anything in 2018. The girl thought I was insane for investing so much in a coin that was basically worthless so she left me. To fulfill the empty space she had left, I bought a shiba inu to keep me company during my lonely times.

But as fate would have it another three years later, the price of Dogecoin shot off and I became insanely rich. So rich that my dream of buying a lambo finally came true and now my shiba and I are riding off into the sunset in our lambo with no care of any bitches in the world.

1449,CryptoCurrency,step11234,"Survivorship Bias is a massive problem in many aspects of life but can be devastating in when investing in crypto (or anything really).

&amp;#x200B;

**What is it?**

It is defined on Wikpedia as:

&gt;***Survivorship bias*** *or* ***survival bias*** *is the* [*logical error*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_error) *of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to some false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of* [*selection bias*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias)*.*

But what does this actually mean for us laymen? It means that you focus on the winners or survivors and ignore the losers or failures tor draw conclusions from.

A very basic example would be in architecture over time, we have so many beautiful buildings from the past (even from ancient times) that one might be tempted to say that they don't make beautiful amazing buildings like they used to! But you rarely ever hear or see about the 99.9% of buildings which were washed away or collapsed to make way for more modern buildings, and chances are these buildings were ugly as sin. **It creates the false impression that older buildings were more beautiful and built to last.**

Another infamous example goes all the way back to World War 2 when the USA military wanted to improve their planes armour but had to pick and choose where to place the armour due to the weight. They decided to examine the returning planes and see where the bullet holes were and place the armour correspondingly, makes sense right? Protect where you're being shot! The problem of course was that these were the *returning* planes, the planes that didn't return were likely shot in places that were much more deadly than the places they had placed the new armour.

In short, it's drawing bad conclusions from only the successful. A very dangerous game when investing your money.

&amp;#x200B;

**Examples of Survivorship Bias in Crypto**

The most obvious example is going to be the big meme coins we have currently. The *moon* that is *safe* and SHIB - both came onto the scene and made a lot of money for a lot of people and inevitably they crashed (although SHIB has had a resurgence in the past week). Many people see these coins making early investors insane returns and now want to find the ""next SHIB"". The fact is that there have been thousands of these coins introduced with literally the same business model with some twist on the SAFE or dog name and nearly all of them have died, but a lot of new people have never heard of those. They only hear of the 10,000x gains from these meme coins as long as you get in early enough! The fact is the majority of people lose money on these coins and their coin will never go up.

I would guess that most people who read this are aware of the meme coins though!

&amp;#x200B;

Another example would be people in this sub whenever their coin pumps. I'm sure we've all seen the flavour of the month coins that do the rounds here whenever they are pumping, LTO, ONE (current), SOL, LUNA, ERG, CKB etc. Notice how you don't hear anything (apart from a few loyalists) about these coins when they are down or crabbing? Because people get excited when they are doing well but they don't talk about their losses or when they are down. It's not something to be proud of that your coin is losing money. So you typically only hear about the good days and this can cause FOMO for a lot of people, especially new investors. Be careful!

***For every 1 story of a guy becoming a millionaire from crypto, there are thousands who lost money or simply went nowhere.***

&amp;#x200B;

**How can you avoid it?**

Honestly it's really hard. It permeates every aspect of life, not just investing. Customer service (loudest voices get the most attention and they are typically the complainers), underdog stories, musicians getting to the top etc.

I see survivorship bias in every day life constantly and it's one of those things you can't be unseen once you realize how bad it is. I definitely fall victim to it and sometimes find myself thinking I made a great investment &amp; I'm so smart blah blah blah before realizing and stupid that is and it could turn sour anytime.

My advice would be to as much research as feasibly possible into the coins you are interested in as well as their competitors. The best thing I've done is to try and do research into failures specifically to see how a coins competitors fared and what their issue was and why they didn't succeed. Does my proposed coin have the same issues or the same potential problems?

I don't think there is any avoiding it completely and we all fall victims to biases and Survivorship Bias is one of the worst in investing. Just to try to be aware of it and hopefully you'll avoid making big mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: You typically only hear about the successful people in life and you should be careful about drawing conclusions from only the winners. Do your research on the market as a whole! Be careful and remember: Everyone is a genius in a bull market.**

I've been in crypto since December 2017, and I have been learning a lot since then. 2020 didn't start very well as I got rug pulled twice 😭, but I got back up on my feet continued the hard work. 

In Sep 2020 at (10k btc) I was waiting for a crash to buy in, but it went all the way up to 64k. Then this year the drop came. 50% drop to 30k and I was getting my cash ready to buy in. My TA said that BTC was going to 5k, so I planned to get in at 5.5k/6k. Since then price has gone up and up and up and I felt terrible having missed an opportunity again; until yesterday.

I am in a couple of Telegrams groups and made a comment in one of them venting my frustration. Soon after, a gent private message me saying that he needed medical treatment and that he needed cash urgently so he will be willing to sell all his BTC (1 BTC) for 10k if I made a bank deposit. First come, first served basis. I couldn't believe it at first but I couldn't pass this opportunity.

There are ways to earn Bitcoin without investing, but they are usually very slow, this is where the faucets come in, the pages that pay us in BTC to see ads or perform tasks. As we all know, no one gives money away, so we will not get large amounts of BTC without doing anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Today we will talk about earning free Bitcoin with interest, in this case we must make an initial investment but it will generate interest over time.

&amp;#x200B;

As we know, Bitcoin is a POW currency, not a POS, therefore it does not have a native stake function, it does not reward us for having this cryptocurrency accumulated in the portfolio as if it happens with Proof Of Stake coins, then

&amp;#x200B;

How can we generate more free bitcoin with what we have?

&amp;#x200B;

For that we must turn to external companies, FinTech companies or cryptocurrency exchanges that give us interest for having the money (in this case cryptocurrencies) in their ""hands.""

&amp;#x200B;

The operation is similar to that of traditional banks, where by putting our money in according to what plans we will receive a reward.

2 Binance Savings

Although the return is VERY LOWER than Nexo, it has the advantage that we must not move the cryptocurrencies, since from the exchange itself we can do all the operations. It gives us the ""assurance"" that it is the largest exchange in the world.

I see a lot of hate on this sub towards people who have made a lot of money with these shitcoins, especially after the latest SHIB pump. 

I agree that these coins are not actually good investments but massive gambles, but you gain nothing by talking down to people just because they bought a coin that you know is not a solid project.

Most people learn after doing things themselves and not from people beating them down and telling them they're stupid for buying certain things. If anything you'll have the opposite effect and they'll double down because they think they're part of a small group that's in the know.

So I'd say the best advice is to just be supportive yet focus on your own projects that you believe in.

# What is it?

* Elrond (EGLD) is a project that is focused on scalability. Their motto is in fact “*The Internet Scale Blockchain*”.   They aim to create a secure, fast and scalable blockchain platform with many applications for a new Internet age.  Unlike many other cryptocurrency projects, development is proceeding as planned. Many other cryptocurrencies, in the past, have only made announcements without actually developing what is foreseen in the roadmap.  In Elrond, on the other hand, they first built a large part of the infrastructure before making it available.  In the cryptocurrency industry, scalability and productivity are major challenges. Many blockchains today take a long time to validate or require high fees, often causing slow transactions. During phase 1 Elrond's token was ERD which then became EGLD with the launch of the mainnet.  In September 2020 the eGold token (EGLD) was included in the main exchanges including Crypto.com where it can also be purchased through the application.  With the launch of the mainnet, the ERD token (ERC20) has been passed to EGLD.  From now on, the native currency in the Elrond network economy is EGLD. All previous ERD tokens will be progressively converted to the new one. Those who have the Crypto.com application can already do it directly. EGLD can be summarized in these aspects:
* Governance
* Staking
* Transactions
* Smart contracts
* Validators

# How does it work?

The Elrond network is made up of some key elements:

* **Nodes and users**: a node is a computer, smartphone or other entity in the Elrond network capable of sending messages. Users transact or run smart contracts. Nodes actively and passively process transactions as validators, observer or fisherman
* **Validators**: they are special nodes that provide for the consent of the blocks by returning a reward or reward. Validators must be nominated and must stake their tokens, we will see what is significant later
* **Sharding**: this term refers to small portions of the Elrond network (called shards) that allow the network to be scaled. Each shard is responsible for a portion of the network (account, smart contracts, blochain) and allows a fraction of each single transaction to be processed in parallel. As we can see, the network was designed to perform operations on a blockhain efficiently in a faster way.

As we know in the cryptocurrency sector, the concept of consensus is very important, a mechanism that allows you to keep each blockchain safe and integral, ensuring its decentralization.   Every transaction on a blockchain is validated through consensus. Each public blockchain network is built in a distributed and decentralized way and does not rely on a central authority as is the case with banks.  When a transaction takes place, the nodes must agree on the validity of a transaction: this ensures that there are no scams and that the blockchain cannot be manipulated. Elrond uses the SPoS consensus protocol (which stands for secure Proof of Stake). They basically improved the PoS mechanism in order to solve network latency problems. In this way, each node can determine at the beginning of each round which members will be part of the group that will give consent.  Thanks to this mechanism, a time of less than 100ms is estimated to elect a consensus group.  Elrond then tries to introduce a weighting factor to promote ""meritocracy"" between the nodes to more evenly distribute the shards.  In short, they have created a more sophisticated and safer version of Proof of Stake, a fair compromise between the increase in energy and the demands for calculation.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallets for EGLD are Elrond Web Wallet, Maiar Wallet, Trust Wallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

- You'll first need to make an account on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile) and access [this link which leads you to Ethereum.org project](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereum-org)

- After making your profile, find your language or your countries flag and enter

- Start completing any files that have less than 100% progress

- UI is extremely simple and you'll get ahold of how it works very quickly

- Now you need to wait. I waited 2 days to get my translations approved and they sent me a link to mint an NFT.



All you need to do is translate atleast one page from English into your own language and you will be eligible for your contribution NFT (or POAP - Proof of Attendance Protocol).

I do advise you to visit Ethereum.org Discord channel (don't know if I can drop any Discord links here, don't want my post removed) and go under POAPS to link your Crowdin profile so admins can send you a link to mint your NFT once your translations are approved.

Diversification is key. Do not put all of your funds into one coin only, because it is very risky. If our signal seems reasonable to you, you can invest up to 10-15% of your seed capital. We do not recommend investing more than this, but of course in the end it is up to you how much risk you want to take.

2) STOP LOSSES:
Always keep in mind that you need to use stop losses. This will minimize your losses and ensure that you secure your funds with each move. It's better to take small and controlled losses sometimes. Remember that there will be enough other opportunities in the future to make profits. 

3) AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT:
If the market is very volatile, it's better to make smaller investments. A good amount to invest if there is a lot of movement is a maximum of 0.2-0.3 (3-5% of funds) btc for each coin. With a lot of fluctuation, you will still be able to make some nice returns, just try to be consistent and secure smaller profits safely whenever there is an upward movement.

ANONYMITY (he was surprised by this) 


Your name is not connected to your account... You are free to use whatever name you want to manage your cryptocurrency wallet. What’s more is that the identities of coin owners are always encrypted... This is a level of privacy that no other currency can promise...

As crypto is completely decentralized – a peer-to-peer system, you are in control of it... You own it. Not tje governments or banks have control over it... 

Critics/butt coiners may point out that it is not completely private as criminals have been tracked using Bitcoin... That’s true but Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency on the market...You could opt for this subs favourite for privacy which is Monero but there is also Dash, both of these alternatives place an even stronger emphasis on privacy... 

 INSECURITY(he was worried of this) 

How can you trust something which has no rules? As us supporters of cryptocurrency are proud of, it is completely unregulated and decentralized...  As of yet, there is no central power dictating the rules of cryptocurrency... 

Also, if you buy something with Bitcoin and get ripped off or scammed, don’t expect anyone to help you. If someone hacks into your wallet, no one is coming to your aid.... This unfortunately happens, but If it happens to you, you’re on your own. This is the risk yiu take with an unregulated system.

CONVENIENCE(he loved this as he believed it would help small businesses grow) 

Cryptocurrencies are perfect for small businesses. Just set up an address and it allows you to receive money from across the world, without having to deal with the hassle government regulations or bank fees.

While cryptocurrencies are still regarded to be in their infancy, many services already accept it as a method of payment especially in recent months... As more people learn about cryptocurrencies, its adoption is bound to grow beyond our expectations imo...

1535,CryptoCurrency,UnrulySasquatch1,"From time to time I see posts talking about the security of PoW vs PoS. In particular I am going to look into Ethereum since it has the most direct comparison between PoW and PoS (for what I hope are obvious reasons)

Throughout this post I have many assumptions, but in general, I give PoW the best case assumption and PoS the worst case. You will see why towards the end.

Let's say you want to attack the Ethereum PoW chain. Let's say you buy one the brand new, state of the art antminer e9. They should run about $50,000 at most since they have a hash rate equivalent to 32 rtx 3080s which would cost you about $30,000 (plus a couple PSUs and 3-4 mining Motherboards). The E9 clocks in around 3GH/s

Note that buying other equipment like GPUs would likely be cheaper because for the antminer you are paying for the power efficiency, but we don't really care about that here since double spends only take short bursts of work to perform.

https://wattummanagement.com/bitmain-antminer-e9-asic/

Ethereum is currently at 715 TH/s, so starting from scratch you would need 715,000GH /3GH = 283,333 miners for a total cost of about $12b (and that would double ethereum's hash rate). If you bought any of the miners from existing miners or just reneged them, the cost would be much lower.

At that point, you could attack the network freely. I can get 1kw for $0.1, so someone with billions at their disposal should be able to get much better, but let's run with $0.1. let's say we want to do a double spend. So we send some Ethereum and 2 minutes later re-org and include a different transaction so it no longer happens. That should take only a few minutes worth of mining to achieve, but goes faster if you have more than 50%. Let's say doing so takes you 15 minutes.

That would consume 2556 watts /hour x .25 hour x 283,333 / 1000 w/kw * $.1/kwh = $18,105.

Basically nothing to actually attack the network. Even if we multiply this by 10, it is easily covered by the rounding on the $12B above.

So all in it would cost you $12b to attack the current PoW chain (maximum). And you should be able to do it for cheaper. And you can do it as many times as you want. If someone blocks your IP,  you can use another or a VPN. There is no way to identify if your miners are good or bad.

Now let's do PoS.

Let's say, in the BEST case scenario. You buy eth from people already staked. And you buying eth doesn't make the price move at all (unlikely). There is currently 7.9M eth staked, so getting to 50% would cost you 7.9M x 50% x $3550 = $14b

The hardware required to do so is negligible, so now let's attack the network. You try a double spend just like before and wait, what's that? The network didnt come to a consensus on finality? The minority chain saw you double spend and slashed all validators that agreed. You lost about $7b in the blink of an eye. The network has some issues for about 2 weeks until it comes back online good as new and your pockets about $7b lighter.

In order to have the possibility of successfully attacking you need a super majority of 66.7% to get past finality. So now let's buy 66.7%. now we are looking at a cost of $18.7B. keep in mind this is Ethereum bought assuming no price action at all and bought from validators currently in the network. (If you bought and wanted to get up to 66.7% from scratch outside the validator pool, you would be at $42b -still assuming price wouldn't increase from your buys)

With 66.7% of the network, you can get to finality. So you can spend, then double spend to your heart's content. Your first one is likely successful. Probably your next few as well if you did them soon enough. But the other validators can see this. Its a huge story and the entire crypto space knows it within about a day or two. Since your eth is tied into specific validators the existing good validators can easily just break off and ignore your validators. Slashing them for the double spend and then counting them as offline. It's trivial to do and doesn't require a code change of Ethereum itself (but would require a client update just ignoring specific validators from the consensus). So now you are essentially running a forked version of Ethereum. Everyone knows your chain isnt right, it had a double spend. So you lose half your eth again, but it's worse this time. Your validators actions are ignored by the network, so you can even withdraw half your eth like you potentially could have under a 51% attack. You lose everything.

TLDR / Summary

The cost to attack PoW would be $12b in the worst case scenario, but would likely cost much less than that (assuming you could buy existing hardware rather than brand new. Buying current operations has the effect of lowering the ""good"" network hashrate).

To attack PoS, at best it would cost you $18B, but likely it would cost you at least double to triple that since buying billions of eth would drive the price up and make it far more expensive for you to attack. Plus people staking aren't exactly selling their eth by in large, so you'd run into issues there.

PoS costs WAY more to attack than PoW and the cost will likely only go up as more validators join and the merge goes live

(Side note Bitcoin is currently at 148EH/s. An antminer s19 pro costs $10-12k and runs 110TH/s would cost you 148000000 / 110 x $12,000 = $16.15b to get to 50% hash rate from scratch)",PoW vs PoS cost of a double spend. I did the math so you don't have to,1633878636

At the moment I'm staking a small capital on the crypto called Time (wonderland.money or something) on Hotbit, honestly it doesn't seem safe but I did want to try with a small quantity.
I've just seen that on wonderland app they offer like 10 times the reward on hotbit, so with a similar small quantity I'd like to start staking on their app, that requires a connection with Trust wallet (or similar wallets, but I only have Trust).

So I'd like to try staking Time but I don't own yet any Time on trust wallet (or any other wallet).

How much this transaction from trust wallet to staking wonderland app will cost circa?). 3. How much could be the cost to transfer back to trust wallet and then re-exchange to avax?

Basically I'm trying to understand how much minimum dollars I need to invest to make the 4-way gas&amp;fees process a low percentage of the invested capital. And then obviously I'll decide if that total is too much for me, or of it's ok.

1541,CryptoCurrency,itstanaka,"First of all, I would like you all for contributing your own way for this community to be as strong as it is nowadays.

I am going to tell you a personal story. 3 months ago I discovered this sub and the potential to earn moons. I have been living in Spain for some time now (although I am Portuguese myself) and I've gotten along with loads of people from different backgrounds - African, South American, fellow Europeans, etc. 

One of these said friends is South American, from Argentina, and although he was here in Spain when I met him, he had to go back to Argentina since he was only here to visit some relatives and to enjoy some vacations.

This Argentinian friend (let's call him Raul) was very interested on the idea of earning moons on this sub as much as I was and we started doing it together, although he is very much more active than I am.

I've talked to him during this week and he was very happy with his moons distribution, which allowed him to receive the equivalent of almost 150 euros. This, of course, to someone who earns a wage in the thousands is only a small sum - but for someone for Raul who is earning 31k pesos per month (rougly 270€ from what he told me, although this value can rapidly change due to inflation in Argentina) it makes a great difference.

Pseudonymity means that identities on the blockchain are not directly linked to real-world identifiers such as names, addresses, or identification numbers. When looking at a block explorer, you will not see names of individuals or institutions, but rather strings of data representing those holders’ public key addresses. 

With enough effort, however, most of those addresses can be linked back to identifiers. This can be done via examination of on-chain activity, transaction histories and trails, and analysis of other data such as timestamps and IP addresses associated with transactions.

For real though, why do all these portfolio trackers/tax services for crypto seem to suck in one way or another? 

Been looking for the “one” to be able to link properly and easily to my exchange accounts, and wallets to just simply track my portfolio in a nice visual way while providing accurate cost basis on coins and compiling it all accurately for taxes.

Maybe I’m asking too much?

Maybe everything is just too new for a comprehensive service like that to work properly just yet? 

Here is all the shit I've gone through already:

**Cointracker** – I’ve had the paid service since last year. Did my 2020 taxes with them. Best interface and visual representation of portfolio. Most accurate as well from what I can tell. However, it has issues. Customer service sucks. Had issues with some coins that took a long time for them to fix, but they did fix eventually. With some calculation issues I had to wipe exchanges and reinput them several times, but it did fix the issues. Latest issue with linking Gate.io and Bybit accounts seem like problem that’s been out there for a long time and really started me to look elsewhere.

**Koinly** – Been trying out for a while, but it just can’t seem to get the calculations especially for cost basis and gains right. Something always seems off no matter what setting I choose, even though totals are correct. Not much of an app for the phone either, but they are working on it. Not a huge fan of the interface but it’s not terrible and could certainly live with it. It also has issues with Gate.io. Great customer service though, but if I can’t trust the numbers, can’t use it for taxes.

**Coinstats** – Was desperate, so looked at this just to track my coins, not even looking for it to do taxes. Great interface, but the chart and the deposit/withdraw totals are beyond inaccurate even though the total up top is correct. Haven’t hooked all exchanges up, but it also is having issues with Gate.io even though it offers support.

**Kubera** – Well it won’t do taxes, and the interface is very basic. Be nice if there were a chart or something showing gains/losses. Does however connect to everything perfectly, and not just for cryptos. More like an online safety deposit box with built in in case you die your beneficiaries can easily find all your assets sort of deal. Might keep for that, but its realty not the sort of coin tracking with taxes all in one deal I’m looking for.

**Zenledger** – I so wish this worked. Interface is great, customer service is great, but absolutely failed miserably linking to accounts. Not just gate.io this time, but ones like coinbase and kraken. Nothing pulled in right, and nothing calculated right.

**Atani** – Just not it. Limited in exchange connections – does work with gate.io but not coinbase only pro – and no connections for wallets. Not much on the portfolio tracking, but if I could connect everything, I’d probably use it despite the limitations on its visual representation of the portfolio because it seems very stable and accurate with what it can connect to. Certainly trust it for taxes. 

Conclusion, I give up. Back to square one and living with Cointracker – cause at the end of the day, it the best of the shit that is out there that I’ve found and used even with its own flaws. Nothing is perfect I guess…

Please though, any suggestions, but only if its something you use, and is not just connected to like one exchange or wallet.",Do any of them work?,1633879789
1574,CryptoCurrency,Blendzi0r,"In 2017, Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft fork was performed and it was the last upgrade to the Bitcoin’s network until today. It was also a controversial upgrade which lead to a hard fork (Bitcoin Cash was born). However, Taproot is supported by the great majority of miners and it is expected to activate via soft fork on November 16th this year.

**Taproot includes three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals** (BIPs) that improve network’s privacy, security and scalability (scalability is, to put it simply, how many transactions per second the network can handle):

1) **BIP340** introduces **Schnorr digital signature scheme** on top of the current Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). In short, Schnorr reduces Bitcoin’s data load, improves privacy and speeds up transaction verifications. Cryptographers generally agree that Schnorr is better than ECDSA in almost every way with virtually no trade-offs.

2) **BIP341** introduces **Taproot** – a privacy improvement that **makes smart contracts more efficient and private** (e.g. only relevant parts of the contract will be revealed. Today, all information is revealed, even that regarding the parts of the contract which weren’t fulfilled).

3) **BIP342** introduces **Tapscript** – a reformed version of Bitcoin’s scripting language that enables schnort/taproot transactions and **makes future Bitcoin upgrades easier**.

Those improvements will result in cheaper transactions and will enable creating complex smart contracts. But their main feature is **making multisig transactions and complex smart contracts indistinguishable from standard transactions** via key aggregation (this will also tackle the main problem of the Lightning Network – privacy).

**Why is it called Taproot?**

https://preview.redd.it/gzb9pl8w5ns71.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93ccbf99d80c0274795120f3a4c80f732f777a12

(A) is how it works today, (B) is how it will work after Taproot activation. Signature verification is the most computationally intensive operation in a script because signatures are verified individually (A). By allowing for signature batch verification (B), Bitcoin can realize its efficiency improvements. **This will open up the possibility of Bitcoin-based Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and other Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications**.

It is also worth pointing out that if Taproot was active in April, when bitcoin transaction fees reached an all-time high, it would have allowed everyone to successfully transfer any number of bitcoins.

**TLDR:** Taproot will increase the number of transactions per second that can be made on Bitcoin, upgrade the network’s security and privacy, enable complex DeFi smart contracts and help with the main issue of Lightning Network by increasing its privacy. Taproot improves Bitcoin’s viability not only as a store of value, but also (especially) as a medium of exchange.

1596,CryptoCurrency,HelloFollyWeThereYet,"Central Bankers around the world created the greatest debt bubble of all time.  Their solution to the crisis is to debase away the debt. In other words, they are rug pulling any debt holders, with the exception of many sovereign debt holders that can print and exchange currencies of their own. 

Who are the bond holders and people getting rug pulled?  It’s a long list, but one example is the workers that contributed to Pension and Retirement funds that hold bonds. Many of those people spent a lifetime working to save for the time when they become old and vulnerable. 

There are millions if not billions of people in underdeveloped nations that do not have banks that are members of the World Bank/IMF and cannot exchange their currencies. Those populations will continue to be exploited by the developed nations. 

A few insightful sovereign individuals decided to create a PlanB after the 2008 financial crisis and Bitcoin was born.  This sparked the beginning of a financial revolution and leap forward in the evolution of money.   With the digital age, the world needs a digital internet for money. 

Initially, Central bankers did everything they could to stop Bitcoin. It may be hard for some to remember, but it wasn’t too many years ago that running a crypto exchange or ATM landed you in prison.  They finally figured out, the genie was out of the bottle. Instead of trying to stop it, much better to take control.  That is when USD stable coins were born.  The Trojan horse.   The way to connect decentralized crypto currencies to central banks and keep the USD as the unit of account. 

Now that the Trojan horse is behind our wall, the next step is for central banks to take control of stable coin issuers by requiring bank charters or licensing. Essentially, turn current US dollar stable coin issuers into members of central banking system.  Soon, Bank of America, Chase and other large banks will have their own stable coins.  I’d bet their smart contracts are going to be more difficult to comprehend than Facebook’s terms of service for users. That assumes, the contracts will run on a public blockchain. They could run on provide blockchain with or without a bridge to public blockchains. 

So, be forewarned.  Not all central bank digital currencies will be called CBDCs.  They will make life more convenient in many ways and increase adoption.  But, they are not a store of value. 

Just remember no matter the yield they offer, they will be controlled by the greatest rug pullers in history.

# What is it?

Monero is a cryptocurrency created in 2014 and released in April of that same year. Its main strength is precisely concerning privacy. Then it also has characteristics common to other virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin. Monero is in fact decentralized and scalable. This means that its value can increase or decrease in scale according to the need and availability of the currency itself. The name derives from Esperanto and in that language it means ""coin"". Monero is also particular because it has a different system from the other virtual currencies derived from Bitcoins and is based on a protocol that is in fact called **CryptoNote**.  The system in question is based on different algorithms and it is no coincidence that it was also praised by one of the developers of Bitcoin Core, an authority in the field of virtual currencies such as Wladimir J. Van der Laan.

# How does it work?

Monero uses, like other virtual currencies, a blockchain system for its transactions, but not very transparent as it is for the sisters of this virtual currency.  The measures adopted for the privacy of those who use Monero are: Ring signature, Stealth address and RingCT (Ring Confidential Transaction):

* **Monero Ring Signature**: The first of these three measures, Ring Signature, serves to hide where the money from a transaction made with Monero comes from. In fact, every single transaction carried out with Monero is inserted into a group of similar transactions: Monero enters the key of your account together with the public keys of other accounts present in the blockchain (using a triangular distribution method).  In this way, an outside observer will never be able to understand which of the keys of this group corresponds to the key of your account (from where the transaction takes place). In short, it is not possible to trace the source of a transaction.
* **Stealth Address**: The second measure taken by Monero serves to guarantee the privacy of those who will receive the money from the transaction. Each time a transaction occurs, the ""sender"" of the transaction must create an address (randomly) for the ""receiver"", which is valid for one use only.  In practice, for each transaction that is carried out, a different address is generated (by Monero) for the recipient of the transaction. In this way, only the sender and the receiver are able to know where a transaction went “to end”.  In fact, in no way is it possible to find a connection between this address created for the receiver and the real address of the receiver. By doing so, the recipient's privacy is always protected.
* **RingCT (Ring Confidential Transaction)**: The third measure taken by Monero is the RingCT, which serves to hide the amount exchanged in individual transactions. This is precisely one of the latest measures implemented by Monero to protect the privacy of its users.  When a transaction with Monero is made, the sender must enter his entire wallet as an input. As the output of the transaction, however, the sender must enter two information:  The first output that the sender must enter is the amount of Monero that he really wants to send to the recipient  The second output that the sender must enter is the remaining amount of their wallet, which will be sent ""back"" to their wallet in the form of change  The transaction is verified with a simple calculation, that is: the two outputs that must equal the input entered are added. In this way it is proven by the system that no new Monero were created during the transactions. Also, the amounts entered for these transactions are never shown.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallets for XMR are MyMonero, MoneroGUI, and CakeWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. One of the most private cryptocurrencies
2. Great devs team
3. Monero can be profitably mined using CPU’s as well as GPUs
4. Probably the most decentralized systems

**Cons**

I know a guy who knows a guy who knew a girl that dated a guy who was mining bitcoin with a GPu, amassed 3000 bitcoin's, put his private key on a USB stick, buried it in a safe in his back garden, dug it up ten years later, left it on his kitchen table, the dog ate it and then ran away.  He offered a reward of 100k for that dog, it was called Shiva.  He never found it.

So anyways, back to the point.  Bitcoin is designed to make EVERYONE rich.  It's so simple it's ridiculous this satsswatoshi guy is INSANE.  All you have to do is BUY IT.  Dead simple.  If EVERYONE buys it, then guess what.  THE PRICE GOES UP.  By my calculations if everyone on the planet buys all the bitcoin they can, the price will go to 1 TRILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS.

We're not talking funny money here we're talking cold hard CASH MONEY BITCHES.  And guess what.  When this magical point happens, EVERYONE ON THE PLANET will be worth 1 TRILLION DOLLARS.  World poverty solved.  We can all buy labs and buy islands.

1609,CryptoCurrency,Markharris1989,"I’ve set out to use some mathematics to prove the amazing future value of all of our Moons. 

I’ve used metric units (because I am Metricanian), a low grasp of high school mathematics, wikipedia and the Aussie dollar for coatings. I hope I have been clear enough that you could localise these calculations for your friends.

So, there will be 250 million Moons distributed in total. 

The distance to Earth’s moon is on average 384,400 km.

So that is approximately 650 Moons per km.

A Lambo gets 19.6 l per km, so we can rearrange to find that every litre is about 33 Moons.

Today I saw fuel for $1.77 per l. So if we divide that by our value above we find that $ 0.05 per Moon.

… wow that’s pretty low. Let’s try something else!

A Saturn V cost $1.23 billion dollars per launch (adjusted) for a payload of 48,600 kg. A Lambo weighs about 1,500 kg.

Therefore a Saturn V could take 32 Lambo’s to the moon at a cost of $38.5 million each. If we divide this by our number of Moons we get *drum roll*

$0.15… well that’s an improvement, but we still haven’t reached the catastrophic highs of hopium yet, let’s try one more thing!

A Lambo is 1.6 m, so we would have to stack more than 250,000 of them atop each other to reach the moon. 

As each is about half a million then that’s a ladder of Lambos to the moon with a total cost of $12.5 billion. 

Divide this by our total amount of moons and we get: 

$500 each!!!! 

That’s it guys, we are going to climb to the astronomical heights that is the crypto moon on the back of a pile of Lambos!",I’ve crunched the numbers and I think I’ve come up with a fair value for a single moon.,1633791000

And please don't be discouraged by people that tells you, or will tell you, ""oh so you made easy money"", NO! They had their oportunity, they will still have it, and maybe not even then they will take it. You're making your own responsible decisions towards your future, you're not wasting your money on that brand new phone, or buying those jordans, or what ever the hell people are doing with their money on these days. You're being financially wiser than the rest. So please, take some credit for that. We're on the bridge of a worldwide change, and we're on the front sit of it. 

So, enjoy the ride, keep faith on your projects, know that price tags are there just to scare you, or make you feel happy, but at the end of the day, the real value of crypto (if you ask me), it's the idea behind the technology, and that it's priceless.","Governments are gonna run out of ink, before they run out of money.",1633791118

None of these tactics involve having no life, I spend a minimal amount of time on them and focus on more important stuff. I will rank my earnings by price.

1st: Earning MOON's on this sub. This is by far the most profitable, I just try to make a few quality posts and comments a month and that usually gets me 2-4k moons depending on the ratio. I would say I earn an average of 650$ from this.

2nd: Earning Donuts on r/ethtrader. Essentially the same thing as MOON's except I'm not as active over there, I usually earn 6-13k donuts so an average of 80$

3rd: Earning PRE with Presearch brower: Just for setting my default browser to Presearch on my phone and computer, I hit the maximum of 30 paid searches each day. This works out to about 45$ a month just for doing searches I would be doing anyways.

4th: Shaking Sats on Shakepay. This is a canadian exchange, they give you free bitcoin every day for shaking your phone. I've lost my streak a few times, but I'm at about 25c per day so that's 8$ a month.

5th: Earning BAT with Brave. Just for using brave on my computer, I earn about 3 BAT per month. That's only a couple bucks, it used to be a lot more.

Well that's it for me, I hope I helped some of you find some passive income methods. Do you have any methods that I'm not using? I would love to hear if there's anything I'm not using.","I earn 800$ of free crypto every month, here's how I do it.",1633791915

Strong gains are coming in the US stock market short term. Nobody knows what the medium term looks like, and it certainly could change to bearish territory in 2022.

I believe we are going to have a major surges over the next few months. If that happens, just be careful. Pulling out too early and you’ll miss some absolutely massive gains. Wait too long and you’ll miss out on some absolutely massive gains.

Doubling and tripling of today’s prices should be expected. If it can be gradual gains for a couple months, then we could see 4x the prices of today, with a massive parabolic move at the very end. If you see 40%+ gains of ETH and/or BTC in a 24-48 hour period, then we are pretty much at the blow off top. And it makes sense to take profit.

Although we might not see 80% declines in value again for the major coins, the recent market downturn in May-June has shown that 50-60% corrections are not over. If ETH goes parabolic over 10k and reaches a peak of 14-15k, i would expect to see a return to the 4-6k levels. That’s not bad considering we aren’t even at 4K right now. So don’t sell yet, the big gains are coming, but there could be another blow off top to take advantage of in the next 2-5 months. Plan accordingly.",We are in the 7th inning of this crypto bull run.

This is to shed light on Egypt’s swift adoption of blockchain technology, (A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. ) We are very much ahead of many countries in adopting this technology, the National Bank of Egypt harnessed blockchain technology from Ripple (blockchain provider) for a remittance corridor with the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

“The remittance market for Egypt is huge, with the North African country receiving $24 billion in 2020 alone, Ripple said, citing third-party data.“


“Given the important role remittances play in the Egyptian economy, the National Bank of Egypt is continuously aiming to develop and enhance the infrastructure which pertains to this line of business,” said Hesham Elsafty, group head for Financial Institutions and International Financial Services at NBE.”

Another usage is Egyptian trade authorities use of “immutably registering and transferring the shipping documents with Ethereum technology.” 

“Captain Ossama Al Sharif, CEO and Chairman of MTS said, “Egypt is proud of its maritime heritage, and we see technological advancements as a driving force of global trade and shipping security, and digitalization and data visibility are essential for better efficiency and transparency.”

# What is it?

*""Nano is a digital payment protocol designed to be accessible and lightweight, with a focus on removing inefficiencies present in other cryptocurrencies. With ultrafast transactions and zero fees on a secure, green and decentralized network, this makes Nano ideal for everyday transactions""*

This definition comes from the official  [NANO's official site](https://docs.nano.org/what-is-nano/overview/), but I truly believe there isn't a better way to explain what NANO is.

**Fun fact**: NANO's network requires so little energy that it could be powered by a single wind turbine

# How does it work?

Nano is a blockchain cryptocurrency that allows users to move money quickly. It competes very well with Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies because its design keeps it safe from the problems faced by its competitors, such as centralization of power, high energy requirements, high transaction latencies, etc...  Like IOTA, Nano uses its block tracking technique instead of the typical blockchain network that Bitcoin and most other coins use. Block-lattice works similarly to IOTA's Tangle, but there are some differences. In Nano's block lattice, each user account has a blockchain. These blockchains are responsible for maintaining the records of user accounts, while the main blockchain only holds a record of these ledgers. This not only eliminates the high storage requirement of blockchain ledgers, as in the case of Bitcoin, but also improves transaction times.  With Block-Lattice the sender sends NANO tokens and signs his block. The last block in its blockchain has an account balance record. The sender signs the new block and waits for the receiver to do the same. The recipient signs the block on receiving the funds and their blockchain is updated with the new balance. Since the funds are sent in UDP (User Datagram Protocol) packets, both parties do not need to be online at the same time, and thousands of transactions can take place at the same time. The fact that only account balances are recorded and not the entire transaction history also improves the load on the blockchain for storage. There is no obligation for miners as users verify transactions directly. In the event of a conflict, the nodes with the right to vote - the result of using the delegated Proof of Stake - resolve the transaction.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallets for NANO are Exodus, WeNano, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. No transaction fees
2. Fast transactions
3. Environmentally friendly (carbon negative network)
4. Decentralized network
5. Scalable

**Cons**

2. It doesn't support Smart Contracts",KnowYourCrypto #30 - Nano (NANO),1633793050

I'm not sure if I was lucky or my timing was perfect....but back when El Salvador legalised Bitcoin and the market crashed...most people assumed the market will never recover again......i was a small time CARDALGO holder back then.....and trust me i was pretty upset like most people watching the prices go down.

But a friend of mine was like we could invest in shitcoins/memecoins....with low price and infinity amount of tokens....he was like if the market recovers we will gain a bit of profit...so i was like why not and invested in it and kept holding.

Honestly we were waiting for some dumb celebrity move or as we know...Elons Floki tweets....which was pretty obvious....and we both agreed....we would sell the tokens on the 4th day of the pump since the hype train usually stays for 1 week.

And finally the day popped in....Elon tweeted about Floki....and some whale bought trillions of SHIB tokens... making this meme coin boom....like planned we sold everything....and i re-invested my profits in good alt coins

Deeds and rights to property? That will be tokenised and processed via smart contracts. Your music collection? Tokenised, as will be the earning rights for trading music. Digital games? Tokenised, enabling pre-owned purchases again. Event tickets, finally ridding us of scammers.

Everything that can be tokenised will, because it removes huge amounts of market inefficiency. Anybody who has bought a house knows how much money is spent on paperwork that adds no real benefit to either seller or buyer. Anybody who has tried to dream up a way to create a digital second hand media market without tokenisation knows how complicated it gets. 

The framework for this is already in place. GET Protocol is already a reality for ticketing. Brave is tokenising ***attention***. Whilst that is still in a very immature and centralised form, BAT will not be the last project to attempt to tokenise attention, and Brave's model is working. Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and such, are effectively tokenised units of computation, no negotiating with salespeople required.

I know it can be tempting to get behind a coin like a sports team once you've put money into it, and you want to be a loyal fan. And that can develop into cultism. But you only need to be loyal to your own money.

Keep two things into focus:

A coin should have something going on about it to realistically make you money, or be a sound investment.

Or have strong fundamentals that you support. A strong innovation or technology that provides a solution, that you want to see flourish and want to support.

Otherwise, what is it all for? 

The second it doesn't do either one of those two things for you, it may time to consider getting out. 

You don't owe anyone or any coin your allegiance. And you don't have to prove to anyone that you have diamond hands. None of these people will the there when you lose your money.

And most of all, you don't have to convince yourself that you are always right and never make a bad decisions.

It's OK to lose, admit defeat, and cut your losses. Everyone, including Warren Buffet, Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, and even me, make mistakes. 

Putting on rose colored glasses sure makes things easier and gives you blind hope. But you can't make smart decisions if you never ask yourself the tough questions.

# What is FTM?

Fantom is a high-performance, scalable, and secure smart-contract platform.  
It is designed to overcome the limitations of previous generation blockchain platforms.  
Fantom is permissionless, decentralized, and open-source. 

Website:[https://fantom.foundation/](https://fantom.foundation/)

# The Team

Michael Kong, CEO: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-kong-89817544/?originalSubdomain=au](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-kong-89817544/?originalSubdomain=au)

He has graduated from University of Sydney in 2017 and has worked in various crypto related projects like Block8 before becoming the CEO of FTM. So I consider him the good for the position.

&amp;#x200B;

Andre Cronje, Defi Architect: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-cronje/?originalSubdomain=za](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-cronje/?originalSubdomain=za)

He founded YFI and is this fantom for 3 years now.

&amp;#x200B;

Quan Nguyen, CTO: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/quannguyenh/?originalSubdomain=au](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quannguyenh/?originalSubdomain=au)

He is in the IT field for 11 years and has worked for FTM for more than 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

# What does FTM do? 

&amp;#x200B;

FTM is the network token for Fantom and can be used for staking, governance, payments, and network fees. 

Fantom tackles the problem at the core: [its high-speed consensus mechanism, Lachesis](https://fantom.foundation/lachesis-consensus-algorithm/), allows digital assets to operate at unprecedented speed and delivers dramatic improvements over the current systems.

 The mechanism, Lachesis, promises much higher capacity and two-second transaction finalization, along with improvements to security over traditional [proof-of-stake](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake) (PoS) algorithm-based platforms. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Future of FTM

 If you are buying with the hope of another 9,710% gain in the next nine months, you may be disappointed. There's a good chance that a frenzy of smart contract speculation has pushed Fantom's price to its recent highs, and there's no guarantee it will hold. Since the market is extremely unpredictable in the short term, it makes more sense to consider how you believe Fantom can perform in the long term.

The basics show that Fantom has solid fundamentals. It has a good management team, and Andre Cronje's involvement provides a sprinkling of crypto stardust. Plus, it has attracted backing from reputable investors like Alameda Research and HyperChain Capital.

It's operating in an extremely competitive space. Competitors like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and more are all fighting for position, each flaunting their high speeds and low transaction costs. There's a good chance that five or six of them will emerge as front runners in the coming years, leaving the others trailing behind.

# Things that makes FTM stand out

**Speed and cost.** Fantom's website says the network can process thousands of transactions per second, with each one costing a fraction of a cent. This is fast, but not as fast as Solana, which can process more than 50,000 transactions per second.

**Adoption.** Real-world usage is going to be crucial for any smart contract platform, and Fantom has a couple of interesting partnerships. For example, in June it announced that Uzbekistan would use its technology to modernize the country's IT infrastructure. It's also attracted several DeFi projects and has $850 million in total value locked (TVL) on the system.

**Technology.** Fantom says that it has solved Ethereum's scalability problem by giving each application its own blockchain, making it a network of networks. Its directed acyclic graph (DAG) differs from other blockchains in that transactions can be processed in parallel rather than more traditional cryptos that use a single processor.

# Threats to FTM in the future

 In addition to competition from other smart contract cryptos and a possible short-term price drop, the main longer-term threats to Fantom are increased DeFi regulation, technical hitches, and wider technical developments.

Fantom is positioning itself as a DeFi hub and has already attracted some important projects. However, DeFi is one area that has regulators around the world worried. The concern is that DeFi projects are offering bank-like products without the same level of consumer protection as actual banks. A **crackdown on DeFi** could impact applications on Fantom's network.

The technology behind Fantom is also relatively untested, and a technical glitch could damage investor confidence. In terms of wider technical developments, blockchain tech is developing at stellar rate. Fantom is one of several newer cryptos that seek to solve Ethereum's problems. But be aware that there may well be even better projects in development. In years to come, these -- or other emerging technologies -- may supersede Fantom's solutions.

# Conclusion

 Fantom is an interesting crypto project that already has real-world applications and deserves its place among the top smart contract platforms. It is currently achieving all time highs so I would suggest to wait for a correction if you haven't entered yet. No one can surely say what the future holds for FTM or any crypto for that matter. But I think FTM can stand out with the competitors like DOT ADA and AVAX as the team is good and the current scene of FTM looks extremely promising.

I’m a fairly active member of this sub and share the same sentiment as most people here on the topic of shit coins. They’re ridiculous but… This might be an unpopular opinion but like that title says I think the value of meme/shit coins lie in the community behind them. Crypto fundamentalists have a tendency to underestimate meme coins and their communities, which is quite understandable considering the wonders of existing and emerging technologies in crypto. 

That being said, I think some of that underestimation or judgment, if you will, leads to losses in opportunities. I also think it’s ridiculous that a certain dog coin has a 32B$ market cap but you can not deny the power in that community and the value that it now holds. Obviously we should be supporting projects that have real technologies and real world usage which is valuable. Hype is also a perceived value and sometimes a hell of lot more successful than actual technologies. 

With proper research and a good entry/exit plan I think there’s a lot of opportunity in meme coins and shit coins. The potential profits to be made from these ridiculous projects can then be put in to other respectable projects. 

I for one have started to look more closely at some of these coins and the team behind them. I’m being really careful around meme coins for obvious reasons but I do think there’s a great deal of potential for short/medium term gains. If you look in those some of these meme coins and their social media and discord communities you’d be blown away at the strength there and that can lead to profits in my opinion.

1799,CryptoCurrency,EwokShart,I was listening to the Unchained podcast yesterday and the two guests were discussing the issues of regulation in the crypto space in relation to the SEC in the United States. The one guest commented that in any emerging market/tech that there are going to be good and bad actors and that regulation serves the purpose to reign in the bad actors while providing supports to the good actors. He hypothesized that even if the space was 95% bad actors that the 5% should not be punished in the process to be legitimate in offering new tech and services. So my question to the hive mind here is who are the current “good actors” in the space and what evidence do we have to say that these are the good actors in the space?,Who are the “Good Actors” in the Crypto space?,1633617749
1805,CryptoCurrency,blothhundrr,"During the past year, this sub has seen immense growth. At the beginning of this year we were just over 1.1m strong. Last month,  we hit 3.5m. That's a whopping 220% increase. I myself am one those 2.4m members that hopped on board this year. 

More importantly, In the last 24hrs, we ranked 6th (SIXTH!!) across all of Reddit for comments made in a day (~28k comments). And 21st in terms of posts made during the same time (1.1k posts). 
That is huge. Activity of the sub, in my opinion, is a much more accurate indicator of the state of the sub than it's growth in members. 

Sure, one might argue that most of this can be attributed to moon farming, and that is most likely true. But just the sheer amount of interaction we have going on here can be nothing but good news for the crypto space. Whether the interaction be merely moon farming or shilling or even just banter, it adds value, no matter how little, in one way or another. 

Before I began my journey to the moon, I was a long time lurker on the r/stocks subreddit. The stock market made a lot of people a whole of money after the crash of March 2020, and consequently the sub grew exponentially too. Up until the MOASS fiasco, that group was buzzing with discussion, TA, news and information, and it really was a great time to be a part of it. A lot like what we have here. 

But after the GME squeeze, what it left in its wake was a ghost town. There's barely any constructive discussion happening there, and not much activity at all. I honestly find the sub depressing now, and it's such a huge loss to be honest. 

There are lessons and comparisons that can be drawn from r/stocks. Both markets have seen a heavy influx of people beginning their investment journeys these past 18 months. Both markets have peaked multiple times and have been setting ATHs in the last 18 months. And both markets have gone through some tough times this year, and arguably the crypto market had it worse during the last crash. 

And that's where this space and this community has proven itself. We've grown exponentially, while the other community has pretty much become a shadow of what it used to be. Fear, uncertainty and doubt has spread as fast as a pandemic across our friends, whereas our belief in crypto has not only strengthened, but also converted many a non-believers. 

We always hear our crypto veterans claiming that a crash like the 2017/18 will wipe out all belief, optimism, and everything we have achieved as a community. I would respectfully have to disagree with that. 

I believe, because you believe. Because we all believe. Our optimism stems from decentralization and a yearning to break free of and challenge a system that continuously tries to suppress us. 

I also want to point out how wholesome this community is becoming. People's reaction to SHIBs recent pump has been amazing. Everyday, I see less and less negativity, and more support, understanding and overall wholesomeness. People literally jump to offer advice to each other, or console a fellow member for their loss, or even cheer for and celebrate each other's success.

Yeah, that's what SHIB fanboys think the hate is coming from, except for me my ""hate"" is the same as when I see a stupid movie get a bazillion dollars from a studio instead of something with real substance.  That's as far as I'm going with my emotions on this.  It's disappointing to see such trash get so much attention while good projects seemed to have a bad week, but it is what it is.

I remember when SOL pumped there were people with substantive posts about why they didn't invest and what cons they saw as a reason to overlook the coin, and people responded with the pros they thought outweighed those cons, and decent discussion was had.  SHIB though?  You try posting about the lack of utility, the fact that it's selling point is a dog, or that it's basically lightyears behind in development from other projects? No no, you must just be butthurt for missing out.  There's no WAY there's a logical argument for why it's a shitcoin.  It's the future and you're gonna be a loser begging on the street with their worthless bitcoin and whatever the F else exists out there, who even knows?

I see stuff pump all the time that I had considered buying into and missed out. It's just how it goes.

# What is it?

Tezos is a decentralized platform used for creating dApps. This cryptocurrency is very similar to Ethereum, because both Tezos and Ethereum blockchains support dApps development using Smart contracts. Tezos, however, has some unique features that set it apart from Ethereum. Most notable is the ***on-chain governance of the network***, which allows holders of XTZ, Tezos native currency, to vote on future decisions made by the network.  The voting feature was designed to avoid community division, which usually results in hard forking or depreciation of the cryptocurrency. The self-regulating nature of the Tezos protocol translates into a blockchain that is easier to update, which at the same time is always open to adding new features.

# How does it work?

Tezos, like Ethereum, is a very useful project. Its two main purposes, as we have said, are decentralized apps and smart contracts:

* **DApps** are normal programs that can be used on a phone, tablet or computer. Just like normal apps, they can be websites or games or services of various kinds. The advantage of keeping them on a peer-to-peer architecture is that they can be made much safer, especially when economic transactions are involved. It also makes them unassailable from the outside and even by the laws, as the use of a blockchain can be condemned but it is virtually impossible to make it stop working
* **Smart contracts** are contracts that can regulate themselves, so that neither party can cheat the other. Through the algorithms applied to a blockchain it is possible to eliminate much of the work of civil lawyers and notaries , replacing them with a faster and cheaper system.

Tezos verification protocol is the **Proof-of-Stake**, abbreviated PoS, the same that is used by Ethereum. This is how new blocks to be added to the blockchain are encrypted and approved.  Unlike the Proof-of-Work (PoW) that is used by Bitcoin, it is decidedly more advanced. First of all, it does not require complex mining machinery, and above all it does not require a huge expenditure of electricity.  This makes the network sustainable and scalable, which becomes neither a problem for the environment nor a race for those who can assemble more expensive and giant equipment to mine tokens. In any case, Tezos' Proof-of-Stake is slightly different than that of Ethereum and other projects like EOS. These last two projects, in fact, have strict rules: the block is formed and must be mined by a person chosen on the basis of some immutable criteria.  Tezos instead uses a “liquid” model, where each person can choose rules on the verification of their transactions and possibly delegate other people to make decisions on these rules on their own.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallets for XTZ are AirGap, Atomex, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. Great devs team
2. Completely decentralized
3. More and more adoption
4. Scalable blockchain

**Cons**

1. Lack of commercial support
2. Low participation in DeFi projects",KnowYourCrypto #28 - Tezos (XTZ),1633618803

No, you’re not angry because people might lose their life savings in a pump and dump.

No, you’re not mad because there are good projects being ignored by lemmings investing in a useless coin that has no real value or future

No you’re not looking out for anyone. You’re mad because people are making money off of something that you dismissed.

No, people who hold BITCONNECT aren’t stupid, no matter if it dumps. Millions of people have made tidy profits off BITCONNECT, and some of them talked about this back in January when we saw the devs behind BITCONNECT were smart as shit.

BITCONNECT, DiarrheaCoin and every other coin that has no real value or future are definitely shitcoins. A shitcoin is an altcoin which is any coin other than Bitcoin. Shitcoins are advertising for crypto and good for hyping the currency as a whole and to make money off of if you are the first to dump.

Paying attention to shitcoins has changed my life, but be warned that If you first hear about a shitcoin on Reddit it’s almost always too late - the community has already setup the pump and is ready to dump. Researching each project, ICOs, following trends and getting in insanely early by investing a few bucks is the way to make huge gains at the expense of your unsuspecting peers.

Patience, open mindedness and attention to details.

Shitcoin investors can't be considered stupid if they themselves think they are geniuses.

1. Choosing the wrong platform to purchase crypto

Any profit we make in trading is not worth it if we lose the amount in the end. Choosing a reliable, secure platform with a good reputation is the first thing to look at. You should invest a few hours of in-depth research in various and reliable forums and news sites regarding burglary, theft or excessive fees.

2. Not using a wallet

A wallet is the safest place to keep your coins. You should differentiate between a hot wallet and a cold wallet and decide whether we want to use a physical or digital wallet. Either way, using a wallet for non-day-trading currencies is critical to protecting against hacking and controlling the wallet's private keys. It is worth remembering, when the currencies are in a trading platform they are not completely in our control and there is a chance of losing them (hacking, bankruptcy of the company and more).

Which brings me to the next section and perhaps one of the most important:

3. Not backing up the passwords to your wallets

Unlike a regular website, in many cases it is not possible to recover a wallet password by email or phone number. The password (12 words and sometimes also Pin) is kept with you only and if you do not back it up you may lose everything in your wallet. Therefore, it is very important to write the passwords in a secure place (not by email, not in a screenshot and preferably not on a computer). The password should be clearly written on a page that has several backups in different secure places of your choice.

4. Posting sensitive information on social networks

Many post on social media the contents of their wallets and the amount of coins they have. The problem - it makes you a target for hacking. In some cases this will give an indication of who should steal.

5. Investing in currencies without research 

This is a phenomenon that has been happening quite a bit lately. A hype is created around such and other currencies. Due to the great influence that the coin makers produce in the network many invest without thinking and discover a day later that the value of the currency has plummeted and individuals have gained something from the investment.

It is very important to check who is behind the coin, what my future is and its use and among how many users it is scattered (the more there is, the better of course and the lower the chance that it is a scam).

An example of a site where you can learn about some of the currencies is bscscan. The site provides information on the amount of currency holders, price and more.
 
6. Making decisions based on emotion.


The field of crypto is indeed a field that can sometimes be profited from, but the mistake many make is to assume that it will happen overnight. Any decline in the market is naturally stressful, but it is worth understanding that it does not make sense for the market to rise and never fall. Sometimes declines are temporary and you should wait and see what happens and not sell out of pressure but out of choice and understanding.

7. Buying high

It is not always worth buying at every rise you see. There are cases of temporary increases and buying at peak is the least profitable time. Although it is not possible to predict when the peak will be and when there will be a decline, but here too, it is worth stopping and thinking and not rushing.

8. Invest money you can't afford to lose 

Another pretty critical tip is to invest only what we can lose without affecting the quality of life. There are too many stories of people selling the car or taking out large loans and being left with nothing. The goal in the sunset is to improve the quality of life and not to degrade it. The more we invest in an amount that is more appropriate to our ability, the less any market decline will force us to make the wrong decisions in the field.

9. Transfer to wallets without verifying the address or type of transfer

It may sound like a trivial detail, but many fall for it. When transferring from wallet to wallet, make sure several times that the address to which you are transferring is correct. Moving to the wrong address means the money is gone forever.

Another and no less important thing. You should see which blockchain is used for transfer. If we use an unsupported blockchain, even in this case, the currencies may disappear forever.

Sure, if you get lucky during the right pump and dump cycle, buying and selling at just the right points, you can make money, but that is like saying you can make money at the black jack table if you get an ace and a king. I buy coins that I think have a future. I am not one of these ""HODL FOREVER!!!"" people, I hold some stuff and swing trade other stuff, but I only buy stuff that I don't mind holding on to for a while because the market may dip and I don't want a thousand page tax return with a million little stop loss sales everywhere. The way I see it, Shiba and the others like it are basically the same as playing the lottery, the problem is it's a lottery where a handful of people (the whales) already have the winning numbers and you are just along for the ride, hoping to get a 3 or 4 number win before they decide to cash out the full 6 numbers leaving you with a pocketful of losing tickets.",The Shiba lottery and why I will never play it.,1633531800

The best part is you can then exchange your newly minted coins for any other Coinbase-supported coin. I've used this to invest small amounts into coins I like over the years, so in reality this number is much higher when you consider returns.

1928,CryptoCurrency,Valynna,"The truth is that tax evasion via legal loopholes is well established both in the developing and in the fully developed world (looking at you Mr. Bezos).

Cryptocurrency is absolutely not essential, nor used for this purpose, and the recent leaks over the past few years have proved, unequivocally, that tax evasion is NOT the primary function of cryptocurrency. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very bullish about this, because it hints at actual adoption, speculation, market viability, and true tokenomics outside of shady / grey-market goods. Even the most common purported coin - Monero - which might be used for illicit activities, represents a very small share of the total crypto market cap, and further demonstrates that the true value in crypto is not grey or black market, but truly above board investment, speculation, value storage, and adoption.

The purpose of this post is to recognize the patterns of quality contributions that are made everyday, recognize and quickly analyze the contents of those that get the most upvotes and make it to the front page. I’ve often wondered why there’s people reaching 15K karma per distribution, but me, writing all sorts of comments everyday, can’t.

&gt;	This post is a self-realization that it is possible with a little bit of research and of understanding the usual trends, and how to make a certain effort to get there, so I don’t need to post a ton of low-quality comment, but just a bunch of really high quality contributions that benefits us all by being more critical, or creative.

&gt;	Having said that, very often quality posts get buried too, this happens, but that doesn’t mean that if you keep trying, you won’t get there eventually. My goal is to make one really high quality post every other day, with detailed information on different crypto topics.

## Critical thinking and insight

-	*A controversial commentary about recent big news.*
   - [Example]( https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q1tgui/bill_gates_said_the_way_cryptocurrency_works/). The user [u/That-Attitude6308](https://reddit.com/u/That-Attitude6308) gives his own opinion on what Bill Gates recently said. His opinion doesn’t have to be objective or the best one, the discussion that was generated in the post was enough to warranty visibility. Made a whopping 16K upvotes.
-	*A controversial commentary in the title leading to a website with statistics or information.*
   - [Example](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/punign/forget_about_china_there_are_100m_people_in_india/). The user [u/Lord-Nagafen](https://reddit.com/u/Lord-Nagafen) provides a link to a crypto site with statistics rather than a news source. His goal was to show factual information on the state of crypto among young Indians. Worked pretty well.
-	*A polemic commentary regarding recent news, or a news that gets reframed bite-sized post.*
   - [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q0hx4v/monero_is_so_completely_private_the_irs_has_a/). The user [u/homrqt](https://reddit.com/u/homrqt) is making his statement on the IRS and Monero’s privacy. He ends the post at the end with a question, to promote discussion.
   - [Example 2](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q10jmq/pandora_papers_12_million_documents35_current_and/). The user [u/Acceptable_Novel8200](https://reddit.com/u/Acceptable_Novel8200) did some research about the pandora papers and listed a few important personalities involved in it. He resumed the news by editing things a bit and reformatting the post, but for the most part, he copied and pasted most of it. Not a hard job, I would say.
   - [Example 3](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pp3ith/amc_will_accept_eth_ltc_and_bch_at_their_theaters/). The user [u/Legal_Smile](https://reddit.com/u/Legal_Smile) reformatted a news of the moment into a bite-sized, easy to read post and included an image to a tweet. This makes things feel more part of Reddit. The best way to do this is to add your own touch and summarize, then add a question. People usually follow content that makes you think.

## Price comparisons

-	*A jaw-dropping fact-checked data sheet that only requires excel skills to put together: comparing prices from then and now, an imaginary portfolio of certain coins, etc. (Warning: if you claim they are true when they are not when the admins ask, your post might get removed)*
   - [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q1uy99/a_year_ago_i_invested_5_into_ten_lesserknown/). The user [u/Supercharmeleon](https://reddit.com/u/Supercharmeleon) makes a comparison between ten lesser known coins and then lists them with their price increase compared from a year ago. He then describes his experience, saying that it was a fun one.
   - [Example 2](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pmqqed/2_months_ago_i_gave_my_kids_100_each_and_asked/). The user [u/gnarley_quinn](https://reddit.com/u/gnarley_quinn) let’s his kids chose among a few crypto projects as an experiment. The post is easy to make fun of, and the comments are pretty fun to read.

## News and quotes

-	*A news article (can be the same article from a different source) asserting a tribalistic sentiment in the title. (Difficult to snipe for a source that hasn’t been posted, and that doesn’t contain unknown writing staff with verifiable sources)*
   - [Example 1](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pw0kgt/leaked_documents_show_that_citadels_ceo_lied/). Credits to [u/Dwez1337](https://reddit.com/u/Dwez1337)
   - [Example 2](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/posj0p/elizabeth_warren_is_now_very_concerned_with_high/). credits to u/Lord-Nagafen
   - [Example 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q1hr5l/griffin_sees_cryptomania_as_jihadist_call_against/). credits to u/isaac_horstmeier
-	*A full quote from a famous person in the title (blockchain leader) linking to an article. (Very easy, doesn’t even requiere much critical thinking).*
   - [Example](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q06h0r/vitalik_on_creating_eth_i_happily_played_world_of/) credits to u/zippyteach

## Guides and information

-	*A full guide about taxes or important financial implications when investing in crypto on the US or other countries.*
   - [Example](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pmiedi/all_the_cryptocurrency_tax_information_you_dont/). The user u/Kevin3386 makes a full guide with proper formatting, tables, analysis and everything you could ask for. This quality content or write up is encouraged. [It even got promoted by the mods.](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pymlmc/_/hev56dm/?context=1)

## Comedy

-	*A half-put comedy post “detailing” a step-by-step guide to do something on the blockchain, but that something is a ridiculous way to “make” money. Uses screenshots.*
   - [Example](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pzgjj9/heres_how_i_turned_001_into_1000000_and_how_you/). *credits to u/AutisticDalekOnSpeed*
-	A parody of popular posts but being absurd, posted in a serious tone. I.e: *A post about technical analysis, but the technical analysis is complete gibberish.*
   - [Example](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ppmnnt/why_bitcoin_will_hit_700k_soon/). *credits to u/Zijdehoen*

### Do you have the wits? Tips for funny comments.

-	Most downvoted comments are comments that don’t really contribute much. If you want to be rewarded for your comments, be aware that people *usually* downvote the most burned jokes/comments that are low effort and irrelevant to the main thread.
-	People will usually upvote a comment that contains an interesting fact, a quote, a witty/clever joke or a self deprecating joke about how you are a bad trader/investor. Elaborate jokes with different steps are much welcome.
-	A	comment that refutes false information from a post or another comment with facts and research goes a long way.
-	Following the Redditor’s humor path:
An original take on ages-old reddit jokes work pretty well across the sub as well, like “Instructions unclear”, and “sir, this is a xxx”, comedy and made-up stories are some examples. Note that you have to make a really personal and original twist that also has a relationship with the context, otherwise, it’d be odd and feel off.

### Brainstorming titles.

Here’s how to make interesting titles, you brainstorm them!

You make a few possible titles for your post, and then choose the one that you think is more appropriate to convey the meaning of your post and also goes along the trends. Here’s an example of how the brainstorming for this post’s titles went:

**Alternative titles:**

-	What is a quality post on r/cryptocurrency?
-	How to make quality posts at r/cryptocurrency and get rewarded by doing it.
-	Tired of moon farming? Here’s what you can do to share quality content on this sub.
-	A quick glance on how the top posts operate.

*Options 1 &amp; 4* felt a bit too general and less catchy, so I opted for the third one.

Believe it or not, titles have a lot of influence. A really high quality post without a catchy title is a no-no. In reddit, the cover of the book is as important as the content.

### Following proper formatting etiquette on posts is a neat and boosting detail.

Did you know that the reddit editor uses Markdown? A post throughly formatted with titles, separators, **bold text**, *italics,* images with footnotes *and* links, makes up for the finishing touches that make everything look elegant and more thorough. To format with more ease, you can use the desktop web app instead of the Reddit app, or the Apollo app for iPhone &amp; iPad.",Tired of moon farming?

1955,CryptoCurrency,Beechbone22,"There was a post about how you can't really DYOR and determine if a crypto asset has actual value or utility and I intended to post a comment there but it got longer ans I thought it was better to just post this. The world of DeFi is pretty much endless and there are new projects popping up every day, but I've noticed that most people are quite DeFi illiterate, even about the basics. If you are a degen yield chaser zoomer bridging to a new chain every week and always chasing the next liquidity incentive program, shitcoin farm or flavor of the week chain, this isn't for you. This is for the people stuck in 2017, and people holding AAVE on their CEX account with 0 on chain transactions.


Many people can't actually research and understand protocols because they don't understand where it fits in the puzzle. Before you can do your own research you should learn about the current DeFi landscape such as dominant money markets on different L1s, different DEXes and the niches they fill, liquidity incentive programs, different yield aggregators and DEX aggregators, insurance protocols, synthetics, collateralized debt positions, liquidity pools and other DeFi primitives . Learn about them and then go and actually use them. See what the UX is like. The same goes for NFT platforms or different L1s, nothing teaches you about crypto and DeFi faster than actually using it. Otherwise you won't have a clue about what a particular protocol or L1 brings to the table. For example, if you aren't familiar with Compound, AAVE, Maker and other money market / synthetic stable platforms, you shouldn't expect to understand the value proposition behind Liquity's interest rate or the efficiency of its liquidation mechanism. Just understanding what you're investing in isn't enough anymore. You should thoroughly understand the current crypto landscape and compare your investment in relation to competitors that are trying to fill a similar niche. I see hundreds of posts and comments shilling scalable and inexpensive L1's because ""it's very scalable and solves the trilemma"" without actually having a single on chain transaction using that particular L1 or any of the dApps in its ecosystem. Don't invest in something you don't use unless it's Bitcoin, because honestly who the fuck actually makes more than a handful of Bitcoin transactions a year? But it's still Bitcoin.


Just to make it clear, this is not a guide explaining the current DeFi landscape, it's a guide about how to go about researching it and it should serve as a starting point for your research. Go and actually learn about these, read blog posts, watch videos, read whitepapers or even better, use them.


If you're looking for a place to start, first of all, you should probably learn about bluechip DeFi protocols on Ethereum. These are:


Uniswap: The most dominant decentralised exchange on Ethereum. V2 had the standard constant product Automated Market Maker that was forked a million times and subjected to vampire attacks on Eth and other EVM compstible chains. V3 has a novel approach to AMM's (that has once again been replicated by other protocols), where liquidity is concentrated on a limited range set by the user and swap fees are structured in different tiers. V3 is much more capitally efficient for LPs and also more efficient for the users.

Curve: Another decentralised exchange. Capitally efficient liquidity pools for different assets pegged to the same asset or different derivatives of the same underlying asset, allowing LPs exposure to yield bearing pools without impermanent loss. Examples are swaps between different stablecoins, synthetic tokens and base tokens, liquid staked ETH and regular old ETH. They also have new pools for volatile assets such as the atricrypto pool. Also very multi chain friendly, they have already expanded to multiple EVM compatible side chains including Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche as well as ETH L2's such as Arbitrum. This is also true for a couple other platforms. AAVE and Sushiswap are also famously multi chain friendly with AAVE having recently launched on Avalanche in addition to Polygon. Sushiswap is on every EVM compatible side chain under the sun but support Sushi incentives only on a couple of them.

Sushiswap: Yet another decentralised exchange. It started as a fork of Uniswap V2 with a vampire attack prior to the launch of UNI token. After some troubled times, it has now become one of the multi chain DeFi bluechips. Sushi team works faster than almost any other DeFi team I've seen. Sushi is no longer just an AMM, they also do isolated lending on borrowing via money markets (Kashi), flash loans, an IDO launchpad and they have an upcoming AMM (Trident) which caters to different niches filled by Uniswap V3 (concentrated liquidity), Curve (stable asset swaps) and Balancer (customizable multi asset pools). 

Balancer: Also a DEX. Liquidity pools with a custom number of assets and a custom ratio between them. It opens new avenues for LPs who are looking to diversify their DeFi holdings while also functioning as a standard AMM.

Note: You don't have to use these protocols individually, there are DEX aggregators like Paraswap and 1Inch that pool liquidity from all these different sources and automatically route your orders through the liquidity pools with the best price, ensuring you buy low and sell high.

Compound: A money market and the protocol that kicked off DeFi summer and yield farming as we know it. Also nototiously suffered from a bug very recently that allowed millions of dollars worth of COMP tokens to be minted and distributed essentially for free. You can lend crypto assets to earn interest and borrow against your crypto via collateralized debt positions, achieving greater capital efficiency on holdings.

AAVE: Another money market like Compound where you can borrow and lend crypto. Currently winning the multi chain money market race IMO. There are also differences with the allowed collateral, collateral ratio at which liquidation occurs, differences in UX, etc. 

MakerDAO: Issuer of DAI, which is a synthetic stable asset minted using other cryptoassets as collateral, and pegged to the U.S. Dollar. It used to be a much more decentralized option, but since USDC became available as collateral, more than 60% of the collateral used to mint DAI has become USDC, which is a custodial, centralized stablecoin issued by Circle. That means an existential threat to USDC is an existential threat to DAI and thus Maker. However unlikely that is, it's still additional risk introduced by a centralized system on top of the smart contract risk posed naturally by DeFi.

Yearn: ""The yield engine of DeFi"". Is managing different collateralized debt positions, claiming liquidity incentive rewards and reinvesting them, chasing higher yields and optimizing debt ratios, LP positions too much of a hassle or too expensive? Yearn is a yield optimizers envisioned to address these concerns without spending gas. It invests the asset you deposit and automatically harvests, compounds and if necessary switches strategies if a higher yield is possible and takes a cut of the profits. This happens in the background without the need for user intervention. Convex is another notable competitor whose TVL has skyrocketed recently, they can also be considered one of the dominant yield aggregators on Ethereum. Both have a highly intertwined and symbiotic relationship with Curve and they both create a lot of the demand for CRV due to its staking mechanisn and they also provide a lot of the TVL for Curve. The yields aren't as degen as other yield aggregators on side chains and alternative L1s, but it's a battle tested protocol running on a battle tested network, offering much better yields than CeFi.

Synthetix: Like it says on the tin, synthetics. Synthetic stocks, crypto assets, commodities, minted using the platform's native token as collateral.

Maybe Bancor? as it has decent value proposition in limiting IL exposure.


Remember that a successful protocol's token doesn't necessarily make a good investment. The native tokens of the dApps mentioned above have vastly different tokenomics, revenue models and rights for holders. For example, UNI is purely a governance token. The only way to price it is speculatively and it depends on how much speculative premium the market is willing to pay for governance rights. The token's price performance doesn't necessarily have to correlate with the success of the protocol. But SUSHI, for example, when staked as xSUSHI, entitles holders to part of the revenue generated by Sushi AMM pools and other Sushi products along with the LPs themselves. The token is also distributed as an incentive to liquidity providers. This means that the market automatically prices the token with the revenue / volume generated by the protocol as staking APY increases if Sushiswap volume increases relative to token price. If the trading volume of the DEX goes up, it naturally drags the price of the token up. Assets like CRV have even fancier tokenomics and staking mechanisms which involve different voting escrow periods for staked tokens and differing liquidity reward multipliers for different amounts of CRV staked. You should always keep these in mind when considering native tokens of protocols as investments.


This list is by no means a complete one but understanding how each of these dApps work will give you a basic understanding of DeFi primitives and how newer protocols and L1s ""fit in"". There are also more innovative products that don't fit in under the above protocols. There are insurance protocols, tokenized real world assets, tokenized future yield and self repaying loans and a million other applications people haven't even thought of yet. Most of these applications leverage DeFi composability and are a good example of ""money legos"" that DeFi brings to the table.


If you want to understand the ecosystems of different L1s, go to defillama.com, and sort protocols by TVL while filtering for different L1s. Explore them, try then out and follow the narrative. Follow where the liquidity is flowing.

Read whitepapers, understand the tokenomics. Twitter posts or Telegram groups aren't actual sources but they can lead you in the right direction. Certain Discord ervers do contain a lot of insightful discussions and research. This sub is probably one of the worst sources of ""alpha"". It's fine to shoot the shit but don't actually take advice from Reddit. People who know what they're talking about very rarely make Reddit posts on this sub about it, though certain niche subreddits may be helpful. Discord servers of even small projects are usually decently active and most devs I've spoken to are surprisingly responsive. Talk to the devs and ask questions directly to them if possible and make sure you understand where a particular asset derives its value from. Don't be afraid to dive into the nitty gritty of it and get technical. Is it a pure governance token, does it have cashflow rights, is there something funkier going on? These are important considerations. Audits aren't everything but they're nice to have.

Also, as a side note if you're planning on using DeFi on cheaper EVM compatible chains (because ETH can obviously be prohibitively expensive for smaller holders). I highly recommend Anyswap as a cross chain bridge for stablecoins and ETH. It's a decent way to quickly move your liquidity around without too many steps and too many fees between side chains and ETH L2s. Xpollinate, Celer C bridge, etc. fulfil a similar purpose so you might want to shop around.",How to actually DYOR about DeFi and where to begin,1633533430

# youves

This a service that allows you to mint synthetic assets by leaving XTZ as collateral. Currently you can only create the uUSD stablecoin and the platform is similar to Maker (Ethereum) or Kolibri (also Tezos), but there will be more than just a stablecoin soon. 

uDEFI is a synthetic asset that is currently being tested and it will work as sort of an ETF for UNI, LINK, LUNA, AAVE and CAKE. In theory any type of asset could be mirrored with youves, so the potential is huge.

YOU is the governance token and it not only gives it holders voting rights but it also lets them earn a share of the platform fees. If you stake your YOU, you are consenting that your tokens could be used for the emergency that loans and synthetic assets become under collateralized, so there is some risk here but you can earn a lot of money if the platform is being used by many people. This also encourages YOU holders to make sure that loans and assets don't even become under collateralized in the first place.

   
 

# Rocket Launchpad

This is a decentralized Launchpad where new projects can raise funds by selling their tokens to very early investors. Kinda like with Binance launchpad, just decentralized.

Currently the Launchpad supports Initial Dex Offerings where you can swap XTZ for the token of a new project, if you have enough RCKT tokens staked.

Soon there will also be Initial Farm Offerings where you can stake liquidity pool tokens of XTZ/RCKT and earn the new token as reward. After the farming is over, the project will receive the XTZ and the RCKT will be burned to reward Rocket users.

Some countries don't allow IDOs without KYC, which is not really possible in a decentralized way, so many countries are IP blocked from the Rocket Launchpad website (you could still access it with a VPN though). This includes the USA and many more. However there are no country restrictions for IFOs and once Rocket is completely a DAO it could become available for everyone.

RCKT is the utility token of the platform. You need to stake it on the platform if you want to participate at the IDOs and you will need to use liquidity pool tokens of it for IFOs. There is a max supply and with the IFOs there will be a burn mechanism, so it will be deflationary.

rkDAO is the governance token of Rocket and will give its holders voting rights for possible changes to the platform. It is currently being distributed to the community. Up until August next year you can earn it by staking XTZ/RCKT LP tokens on Crunchy.

# How it works

Majority of blockchain projects are focused only on one layer, blockchain. For real business to adopt blockchain solutions much more is needed. ​​

Solve.Care platform leverages **Blockchain** and full stack capability to deliver significant business value to individuals and enterprises: ease of usage, privacy, security, control and ownership of data, human interoperability, auditability and enhanced trust between parties.

&amp;#x200B;

Solve.Care is a network built upon Care.Protocol. This unique protocol allows for any existing healthcare networks and services large and small to plug in play on the Solve.Care platform. Each network on our platform is called a Care.Network. These networks can be hospitals groups, private practices, telehealth exchanges and more. Solve.Care is unique because it allows networks to run independently but to also have a fabric underneath that allows them to all communicate.

# Who Does it Benefit?

Our platform is designed to benefit everyone! Let’s take a look at how each party can benefit from Solve.Care’s unique platform.

# Patients

Healthcare becomes much easier to manage on the Solve.Care platform. Everything is centered around Care.Wallet which is available on Google Playstore and the Appstore. With one application patients can manage their appointments, payments, connect to a doctor via telehealth, synchronize data from the healthcare devices and much more. With Care.Wallet, the patient is in control of their own data and with Care.Circle they can choose who in their life they want to see their data and help them manage their healthcare journey.

# Physicians and Specialists

The Solve.Care platform allows healthcare providers to spend more time doing what they love, helping patients. Blockchain technology can reduce the administrative burden on physicians which is currently a huge distraction from time spent with patients. Solve.Care’s products like our Global Telehealth Exchange allows physicians to remove borders and boundaries and help patients around the world on their own schedule. Smart contracts and digital currencies make payments instantaneous when the normal average in healthcare can be up to 8 weeks.

# Healthcare Providers

Solve.Care is unique in that it is one of the few applications in blockchain that brings massive economic value to its clients. One of the biggest overhead costs in healthcare today is administration. Administrative costs have continued to increase year over year and become a burden to society. Blockchain and smart contracts remove a massive amount of administration. Having blockchain based credentialing and pre-approvals cuts out a lot of time spent communicating between parties. The use of permanent ledgers and automation makes it easier to audit systems which reduces waste and fraud.

# Our Clients

Solve.Care has clients, service partners, development partners and growth partners. Our platform was not just designed to attract clients but built alongside clients to ensure our product fit was exactly what the industry needs. While partnerships are great for growth, our clients are what bring real world adoption to our platform. Here are some of our clients.

Our platform also allows physicians to control their own schedule and rates.

1. Provider Rewards Network: Launched with the Arizona Care Network this Care.Network shifts the incentive structure of healthcare providers away from offering services and towards helping patients. This platform gives rewards to physicians who recommend services which help the patient get better.
2. Diabetes Care Network: Launched with Boehringer Ingelheim this network includes many tools focused on helping diabetes patients manage their chronic condition.
3. [Team.Care](https://teamcare.solve.care/): Launched in response to COVID-19. This product gives employers a safe and private way to check in with employees and keep them safe.

# SOLVE Token

The SOLVE token is the utility token for the Solve.Care platform. This token creates a global payment system inside of the Care.Wallet and creates a unique ecosystem between healthcare providers. SOLVE is the gas of the network and is used for every healthcare transaction and every Care.Network.Every Care.Network uses the SOLVE token. There are five ways the SOLVE token is used:

Establish Identity

1. Transact in a Care Network
2. To make a payment in a Care Network
3. To share data between network participants or across networks
4. To give and request consent

# What is to Come

Solve.Care does not wait around for things to come, we work 24/7 to build a bigger and better platform. Our main focus is on utility and growing the number of wallet holders. As of this post, our main focus is growing our Global Telehealth Solution, growing our clients and adding more Care.Networks. These three things are chosen as they are the quickest way to grow our utility, user base and token demand. Stay tuned to our reddit and our telegram for the latest news.

I’m not going to actually do this, and frankly, I lack the knowledge to even know if it’s technically feasible. However, a coin designed to wipe out capital gains for the year only to resurrect them a day later would be pretty wild.

My (uneducated caveman) thoughts:

-	Before 12/31, the coin would be locked to $1. On 12/31, it would drop to .01. On 1/1, it would rise back to $1. Buyers would need to determine how many coins to buy prior to the drop in order to make their capital losses for the year equal or exceed their capital gains.
-	From a technical standpoint, I have no idea if this would require rebasing, a scheduled oversupply + burn, or some other method I’m not clever enough to consider.
-	The coin would need a mechanism to prevent new buyers when it drops on 12/31, otherwise a ton of people would jump in to ride the guaranteed bump on 1/1.
-	This is where it gets hard/stupid. Since I know at least the USA IRS requires a buy/sell transaction to qualify for a taxable event, the coin itself would somehow need to record a sell transaction within the blockchain on 12/31 to ‘lock in’ the capital gains loss, then a buy transaction for equal amount before the price rises automatically. Otherwise, tax payers would just have a temporary value swing and no taxable event to refer to if audited.

Any thoughts on this, crypto gurus? Again, this isn’t something I’m actually planning, and I am not recommending it for anyone else. Just want some fun conjecture","My stupid tax idea: A coin guaranteed to lose value on 12/31, then rebound on 1/1",1633447761

 The Biden administration is moving beyond vague hints on how it will regulate stablecoins to more concrete descriptions.

#### Why it matters

Stablecoins have exploded in popularity over the past year or two, with some $130 billion worth of these fiat-pegged tokens in circulation as of Sunday night, according to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins). Regulators have been eyeballing this specific sector of the broader crypto industry for nearly a year, and we’re finally seeing their response.

2108,CryptoCurrency,baily78123,"Saying Tezos has exploded this year would be an understatement. Network usage has risen drastically thanks to a booming NFT culture and growing defi projects and eco-system. Smart contract calls are through the roof closing at almost 6 million for the month of September. Compared to the September from the year before is an increase of almost 4400%! 

Some reasons to look into Tezos:

-Tezos is decentralized.

- LPOS lets you delegate your XTZ directly from your wallet, letting you be in FULL control of your coins. Simply delegate your XTZ to a baker who supports the proposals you support and voila!

- Tezos has fully functional on-chain governance, allowing it to adapt  as needed, and quickly, without the use of hard forks. 7 upgrades implemented so far which is a huge feat, and an 8th upgrade that includes Tenderbake which will bring deterministic finality (1000tps), planned for the beginning of 2022.

- Fees are dirt cheap, from my experience usually around 0.001 XTZ (Pennies) with more scaling solutions being built.

- Tezos has no issues with sustainability as it uses Proof of Stake, the energy it takes to mint an NFT is less than what it takes to power a light bulb.

- Speaking of which, NFT's are huge on Tezos right now with projects like OBJKT, Kalamint, and especially HEN (hic et nunc) having seen amazing growth in users, delivering some of the best Art in the crypto space.

- If you are a fan of Ethereum like myself, theres a protocol named WRAP that allows you to WRAP your ERC-20 tokens onto the Tezos blockchain (WWBTC, WWETH, WLINK, WAAVE, etc), Which you can then use in defi to earn high APY on your assets. 

- Speaking of Defi If you are into yield farming Tezos has some great opportunities, I currently use Plenty which just today was listed on both Coingecko and CMM. If youre interested APR's have ranged from 120%-300% for a while now.

- Very good community focused on building and helping newcomers. With the recent rise in market cap it was very nice too see no ""MOON"" talk from the community (with a few twitter exceptions).

- Tezos has HUGE partnerships with big EURO banks, F1 racing, Redbull, Real estate firms, etc. Its truly crazy how many Institutions are adopting Tezos, at only a $7b market cap!!

XTZ has a very bright future ahead of it. Decentralization and its on-chain, secure and fast upgrades will keep it ahead of the pack for the foreseeable future. 

Thanks for reading and Im sure I can speak for most of the Tezos community when I say we'd love to have you on-board! 🤓","Ada and Sol friends, You should definitely look into Tezos.",1633358959

2144,CryptoCurrency,korabdrg,"&gt;“A hard spoon is a meta-protocol on top of a blockchain creating a token that inherits the blockchain’s underlying token’s balances. The idea of a soft spoon would be to create two competing \*branches of a protocol\* within \*the same blockchain.\*” — Vitalik Buterin

The term ‘Hard Spoon’ was first coined by Jae Kwon, Founder and CEO of [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint). A ‘Hard Spoon’ involves the creation of a newly minted cryptocurrency, on a different blockchain, for a cryptocurrency that is already in existence. The account balances are replicated from the existing cryptocurrency. Essentially, you end up with two cryptocurrencies that are run parallel on different blockchains, where each has its own value, can be used for staking, and is also tradeable.

&gt; “Hard spoon: a new chain that takes into account state from an existing chain; not to compete, but to provide broad access.” — Jae Kwon

The Hard Spoon allows for cryptocurrencies to exist on multiple blockchains, while taking existing account balances into consideration. This allows current token or coin holders to receive the same amount of newly minted tokens or in any other ratio that is not 1:1 based on an account balance snapshot that can be used prior to distribution.

A key component of the Hard Spoon is that it is non-contentious. It is not intended to result in  competition or ‘steal’ market share from the original chain. The goal is to provide broader access to a cryptocurrency by replicating a coin or tokens account balances and minting a parallel cryptocurrency that functions on a divergent blockchain. This is bound to offer greater efficiency and boost performance over time.

&gt;A key takeaway here is that this allows a new world of developers and programmers to work with existing community members from the original chain to ultimately explore the platform and improve on any deficiencies.

Hard Spoons provide mobility to avoid blockchain-based restrictions and helps expand a cryptocurrency’s reach and thus promote greater use and adoption.

 For example, if a cryptocurrency were initially launched on the Ethereum Blockchain, but the team found a faster, interoperable blockchain to utilize for its token purpose, it could conduct a Hard Spoon. This involves taking the account balance of existing holders of the specific cryptocurrency and replicating the token or coin to function on a divergent blockchain that better suits its needs. Both cryptocurrencies would be functional.

Two of the first highly coveted and important Hard Spoons are set to occur during Q2 2018. Ethereum (ETH) and [OmiseGO](https://medium.com/@omise_go/o-m-forking-g-1cc257b890ec)(OMG) are preparing to Hard Spoon on the [Cosmos](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-cosmos-blockchain/)Network, the self proclaimed internet of blockchains. In simple terms, Cosmos is the blockchain and Tendermint in the software that is responsible for committing new blocks to the blockchain. You can read more about the specifications as they relate to OmiseGo (OMG) [here](https://blog.omisego.network/o-m-forking-g-e6925aca9c96).

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who is currently running for re-election, “moved US$22 million through offshore companies to buy a lavish estate on the French Riviera in 2009 while keeping his ownership secret,” ICIJ said. The five-bedroom Chateau Bigaud, which is owned by a subsidiary of one of Babis’s Czech companies, sits on 9.4 acres (3.8 hectares) in a hilltop village where Pablo Picasso spent the last years of his life, the group said.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Queen and Azerbaijan**

The data release revealed that Azerbaijan’s ruling Aliyev family traded around US$540 million worth of U.K. property in recent years, reported the Guardian, one of the ICIJ’s media partners. Queen Elizabeth II’s Crown Estate bought one property worth almost US$91 million from the family, and is currently in the middle of an internal review into the purchase, the Guardian said. “Given the potential concerns raised, we are looking into the matter,” a spokesperson for the Crown Estate told the paper, which added the Aliyevs declined to comment.

They also own a £33m office block in London for the president's 11-year-old son Heydar Aliyev.

&amp;#x200B;

**South Dakota, Nevada havens**

One of the most “troubling revelations” for the U.S. was the role of South Dakota, Nevada and other states that have adopted financial secrecy laws that “rival those of offshore jurisdictions” and demonstrate America’s “expanding complicity in the offshore economy,” said the Washington Post, one of the ICIJ’s media partners. A former vice president of the Dominican Republic finalized several trusts in South Dakota to store his personal wealth and shares of one of the country’s largest sugar producers, the paper said.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Lebanon Elite:**

The leaked files also showed that in Lebanon, top political and financial figures have embraced offshore havens.

These include Prime Minister Najib Mikati, his predecessor Hassan Diab, Riad Salameh, the governor of Lebanon’s central bank – currently under investigation in France for alleged money laundering – and former minister of state and the chairman of Al Mawarid Bank Marwan Kheireddine.

The consortium said Kheireddine and Diab did not respond to requests for comment while Salameh said he declares his assets.

Mikati’s son, Maher, told the ICIJ that owning real estate through offshore entities offers more “flexibility” when it comes to renting, inheritance planning, and “potential tax advantages”.

He told Al Jazeera that: “Using offshore entities could be considered as forms of tax evasion for US and EU nationals but this is not the case for Lebanese nationals.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Pakistan’s political elite**

Several members of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan’s inner circle, including current and former cabinet ministers, “secretly owned an array of companies and trusts holding millions of dollars of hidden wealth,” the group reported. That could create a political headache for the former cricket star, who campaigned for the South Asian country’s highest office as the head of a reformist party that promised a strong anti-corruption agenda. Before the release of the Pandora papers, a Khan spokesperson told a news conference Khan had no offshore company, but ministers and advisers “will have to be held accountable” for their individual acts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tony Blair property purchase**

The documents show former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife saved around US$422,000 by using an offshore company to purchase an almost US$9 million office in London’s Marylebone area that was partially owned by the family of a Bahraini minister, the Guardian reported. The paper said there was nothing illegal about the deal, but it “highlights a loophole that has enabled wealthy property owners not to pay a tax that is commonplace for ordinary Britons.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Russian Elite:**

The Washington Post said Russian woman Svetlana Krivonogikh became the owner of a Monaco apartment via an offshore company incorporated on the Caribbean island of Tortola in April 2003, just weeks after she gave birth to a girl.

At the time, she was in a secret, years-long relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Post said, citing Russian investigative outlet Proekt.

The report also revealed Putin’s image-maker and chief executive of Russia’s leading TV station, Konstantin Ernst, got a discount to buy and develop Soviet-era cinemas and surrounding property in Moscow after he directed the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

Ernst told the organisation the deal was not secret and denied suggestions he was given special treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

**And the list continues::**

Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta and six members of his family secretly owned a network of offshore companies. They have been linked to 11 firms - one of which was valued as holding assets of $30m.

&amp;#x200B;

The law firm founded by President Nicos Anastasiades of Cyprus appears to have provided fake owners to disguise the real owner of a series of offshore companies - a former Russian politician who had been accused of embezzlement. However, the law firm denies this.

&amp;#x200B;

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky transferred his stake in a secret offshore company just before he won the 2019 election.

&amp;#x200B;

Ecuador President Guillermo Lasso, a former banker, replaced a Panamanian foundation that made monthly payments to his close family members with a trust based in South Dakota in the US

They were very stressed and really felt like they are getting old because of all the technology that's going on around them. For their flight they needed digital versions of vaccine, plane ticket, check in, order a taxi, etc. To us this is normal, to them its a totally different world than they were used to.

2184,CryptoCurrency,LemonEffect,"Hello everyone, I saw some posts in the recent days, that unlike shilling shitcoins, a lot of people are interested to know about new projects and why they are so exciting.

&amp;#x200B;

Thats why I took some time to introcude you to one of my favorite projects now, that probably no one of you have heard of before:

&amp;#x200B;

RAMPDefi!

[User Interface](https://preview.redd.it/d6i8jayxdgr71.png?width=1459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b89b8b1afd3e391263d7052b56cd7ad437b28536)

&amp;#x200B;

RampDefi is a crosschain lending platform (currently BSC, Matic and ERC20 - more to come), that allows you to stake your precious assets, earn decent APY and lets you collaterize them to mint their algorythmic stablecoin rUSD.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of you guys, including myself, have been in the position that the market dumps and we are out of cash and missing on the chance to buy the dip..

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe you want to participate in other staking or yield farming possibilities, build some passive income, but you dont want to sell your existing coins..

&amp;#x200B;

You have tons of possibilities with their rUSD stablecoin.. You can stake it on the same platform for even higher yield, transfer it to other chains with their integrated bridge, exchange it into any other token of your choice or add it to LP tokens and earn some of the exchange fees!

&amp;#x200B;

Their own RAMP token is currently sitting at #389 in marketcap and is one of the top 10 coins in safety rank on the Polygon Network. The token is also used for staking, voting on their platform for more functionality (more ecosystems added in the future like Polkadot, Avax, Solana, Cardano etc. and more stakable tokens) and collaterizing. All the fees that are generated are used to buyback the RAMP token and burn it. So the more people are gonna use the platform, the more valuable the token becomes. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Safety Rank](https://preview.redd.it/kwy11mo4egr71.jpg?width=956&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c626e352dddcdb68df1c6c705fe73f3c59814e98)

I have personally used the platform since the beginning of march and had a great experience so far. The user interface is super clean, easy to understand and easy to use, never had any downtime until now as far as I know. They are constantly adding new useful features as the mentioned bridge, integrated exchange or a night mode for example. I was able to leverage up my gains greatly, took advantage of the dips via minting rUSD, the rewards of my staked assets auto-compound and let my stack of stables grow.

&amp;#x200B;

I highly suggest you check out their platform, you will find a lot more info there, but you are welcome to ask questions. I might add some more infos if enough people are interested.

[All the infos on their platform \(DOCS\)](https://preview.redd.it/5oia7up7egr71.png?width=1448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=830bf0a7ab9f23f8537e793512cf939d0b242731)

2202,CryptoCurrency,Letsmakeitawsome,"**TL;DR Currently it is, almost entirely, ticketing companies who finance huge events. Private capital is almost excluded for event financing. Decentralized event financing brings both ticketing companies and private capital to the table. In the future it will be possible for everyone to invest money in world tours of Ed Sheehan, Eminem, Ariana Grande, etc.**

Large events require huge amounts of upfront capital to bankroll. Regardless of the amount of times an event has fully sold out, finding financing is always a challenge for organizers. This while the financing is needed for a relatively brief period of time. The money is mainly needed as a bridge between the reservation of the venue and deposit payment to the artists and the ticket sale (generally 6–10 months).


It is well known fact that banks have largely stepped out of providing loans to businesses and start ups. This role of providing financing has, in other sectors, been taken over by private investors and funds. In ticketing most financing is now provided by ticketing companies.

The bottom line explaining the challenges in finding reasonably priced credit is that the loan collateral are effectively the tickets. Surely a borrowers brand and equity can used as collateral but in the end it is the tickets that are assumed to generate the future cash flows. Tickets are fleeting/wasting assets that are hard to access fair value of. Partly because there is a chance the tickets will be worth nothing at all.

Due to the pandemic even the once so aggressive conglomerates as Eventbrite (fired 45% of staff, left Dutch &amp; other markets) and Live Nation (have had problems with outstanding debt) have been bitten and have since been less inclined to take on more risk. Event sector is becoming strapped for credit.

What happens when event industry that is valued at around 65-100b dollars (as different information sources suggest) will be disrupted by decentralization, blockchain technology and NFTs? 

It will be possible for each and everyone to participate, invest and generate yield on event financing, event ticketing and different secondary markets (collectibles mainly)

2209,CryptoCurrency,savage-dragon,"Gold: 10 trillion Biden dollars.
Real estate: 200-250 trillion Washington dollars.
Stocks: 90 trillion Obama dollars.
Bonds: 120 trillion Trump dollars.
Derivatives: 600-1000 trillion but these figures are grossly overestimated (realistic gross value is estimated to be 12 trillion Clinton dollars).

Our favorite exit strategy coinz: $2.25 trillion 

So what can we gleam from this?

Let's Google crypto sentiments: recently we see more and more millennial and gen Z folks are warning up to crypto. Based on surveys about as much as 10 to 40% of the younger populations are willing to invest in crypto. These figures can be wrong because the sample sizes are small and are collected in major cities but still, like it or not, millennial and gen Z, those growing up with memes and tiktoks and social media and the internet, will one day replace boomers and run this world. 

Even if we try to be conservative and assume that 30% of the population will use crypto as an investment vehicle by 2030... we can see that 2.25 trillion market cap is but a drop of water in the global investment market cap of $500 trillion.

Here are some milestones crypto can aimed for in the next 10 years:

1. GOLD: this is the obvious milestone for the entire crypto marketcap to surpass and this is the ultimate goal for Bitcoiners to hope for eventually. A $10 trillion Bitcoin marketcap will place bitcoin at roughly $550k a pop.

2. Real estate: well this is trickier to analyze because as living corpse-fleah not yet ascended into the digital metaverse, we still need shelters. So real estate can perform the physical functions no crypto or NFTs can. However a large percentage of the real estate marketcap consists of speculation and investing rather than real physical needs. If we say 60% of the real estate market is pure speculation and investment vehicles, then we end up with about $100 trillion in investments and those real estate are held because ""numbers go up"".

3. Stocks. Stocks are a physical representation of tradfi ideation of companies. Crypto companies and DAOs will eventually  take a chunk off that market in my opinion. Let's be conservative and say crypto and DAO + tradfi adoption can push the crypto marketcap towards 20% of stocks... and we end up with $18 trillion (possibly $22 trillion adjusted for stocks growth). This is still a vastly bigger number than our current market cap.

To conclude, I'm not saying the growth figures for crypto I'm providing are correct. My point is, our current marketcap is literally nothing compared to all these traditional investment vehicles. It's not that crazy to expect our market cap will 5x or 10x from here within the coming decade, given how young people prefer to spend their time in the digital worlds and how they're less likely to own gold or bonds.",Just to give you a scale of how TINY the crypto marketcap is compared to other traditional assets.,1633272809
2216,CryptoCurrency,Winter-Divide-8049,"This only applies to people that attempt to actively trade the market. A HODL'ers strategy is very different and this is not directly applicable to them.

I see a lot of people take crazy losses in crypto (I really only care about my friends, whom I originally got into the crypto). And these people are often so surprised by massive pullbacks and taken off guard by it. They panic sell and never know when to buy in again. They do it too late, then boom another pullback. I can't babysit all of my friends trades enough to keep them positive and making smart moves.

Which leads me to believing more people need to understand the money-flow charts more than any actual analysis of altcoins or bitcoin individually. I use these charts almost exclusively to give myself an idea when to buy in and to start taking profits. On tradingview, I use a combination of TOTAL, TOTAL2, TOTAL3, ALTPERP, TOTALDEFI, BTC.D, and BTC to find confluence for buy-in and take-profits.

An opposite example is how many of my friends were shocked by the massive Bitcoin move the other day. They were amazed to see bitcoin just pump like crazy, and I will certainly say that I didnt expect the almost 10% that it moved, but here are 2 simple plots that give me the idea that a move was coming.

[Total Market Cap](https://www.tradingview.com/x/o535bf05/)

[Bitcoin Dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/7MTiF4w8/)

Both of these plots show long continued trends, and bitcoin dominance was coming to an apex. Again, I did not know the direction of the move. As a matter of fact, I was completely in USDT because in the event things went south, they would have gone VERY south. So I played it safe and am waiting for new market structure to form.

But by just using those plots I was able to at least expect something to happen. It seems so many people are flying blind. And this really only bothers me for my friends that attempt to trade for themselves. 

I've ben contemplating finding a way to make these charts public and actually keep people updated on them. I don't see many people using these charts, all I see on twitter and youtube are shilling of micro caps and the obligatory Bitcoin going to $69,000,000 predictions.

2221,CryptoCurrency,RoaringRedStag,"So I decided to move most of my funds into crypto, because my bank is just taking my money all day everyday and instead of the interest I received when I was younger I’m now paying them a good 100 € a year for keeping my money. While I can earn up to 12% interest in crypto, without paying any fees.

As a backup I keep a locked bank account that covers my maximum credit card limit for a month. I also have some physical gold and silver.

Im fine with the overall volatility, I’m a daytrader so I live off of that. I’m not really into constantly risking all off my money though so I’m still figuring how to get a proper risk to reward.

So far my idea and goal for the end of the year is:

50% stablecoin
20% established top 50 cryptos
20% moonshots
10% „technically superior altcoins“

For stablecoins I figured Thether is big nono, Usdc is decent, TrueUsd is king because actually backed 1:1 with the most transparency. I’d prefer a Euro stablecoin, but that’s not available on my exchange. Once that is available I will hold Eur/Usd 50:50.

For established top 50 cryptos I chose Litecoin and Crypto.com coin. Litecoin because my broker supports payout in Litecoin and I got the biggest chunk of it at around 145 Usd, which I can hold comfortably until the end of this bullrun. Once price action stalls I’m going to sell most for stablecoins and stake that. Crypto.com coin because I need it for the stake to get the debit card anyway. I use the cashback in CRO to get returns with the CDC supercharger, overall in love with CDC. Bitcoin turns me off. I just have a bad gut feeling, if crypto really overtakes Fiat I don’t see a reason why Bitcoin would keep it’s top spot. Anything Bitcoin can do some other crypto can do better and I don’t think people will hold onto it forever simply because it’s been there first. Might be wrong about that, but I rather miss out on some gains than live with a constant worry. I paid too many gas fees with Eth so I rage sold everything I had.

For moonshots I chose Shib, Quant and Nano. Don’t shame me fo Shib, I know most people in this sub consider it a shitcoin. But if you look at what actually happens in crypto - Shib gets listed before many technically superior projects, Litecoin is a Btc fork, Doge a Litecoin fork, yet Doge has a higher spot than Litecoin. Crypto price movements don’t always act as they should from a logical point of view. So that’s why I gave it a shot. I also like the idea behind it, just not the slightly cringy swap.

For „technically superior altcoins“ I’m currently only holding One. I had some Algo and Holo, but sold that for a slight gain. Didn’t do much research on those and didn’t feel comfortable holding coins I actually don’t know much about. So I’m glad for some input on that.

So yeah, I’d be grateful for any ideas and recommendations. I’m also still figuring how to get maximum security, those post about people getting hacked still scare me.

LocalBitcoin is not the most used one, but it is the one that publishes it's stats. Others are Binance (which I'm sure is the king, because you can go BTC/DAI/BNB/ETH/USDT directly to Bolivares back and forth), Reserve, AirTM, Uphold and so on. Coinbase and Robinhood don't work here.

Months ago LocalBitcoin was king and like 10 times was traded weekly.

* Average wage is around 80 USD monthly
* A family needs around 400 USD monthly to ""live"" (5 members)

Most people use crypto to receive remittances from abroad, cash out when mining, getting paid and even the goverment uses it for sure (sadly).

And yes, don't get me wrong, there are some projects on the cryptoverse that are just made for make a rug pull, mostly promoted by celebrities, or promoted on obviously scam websites like cryptomoonshots.

When you see countries like Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Argentina (who once was one of the richest countries in the world, top 5 actually). Those countries have been a victim of the biggest rug pulls that can ever be made on the history of human kind, where they actually made people work their entire life for a scam ""coin"" who can be printed at their will, and it will be losing value overtime at a rate out of this world. Venezuela it's up to 2700% inflation rate... Can you even imagine if crypto projects would put out of nowhere more and more and more coins into the market, and just keep increasing the ammount of coins available just 'cause they want it that way? The crypto world would be bombarded with con-arguments, and it would be on the lobbyists portfolio arguments to attack the cryptoverse.

And, don't get me wrong, but, at least... crypto rug pulls are made to people who freely went into that project. On the otherside, you can't *always* choose where you are born, and where do you get to work, so you are forced to work for and with a certain currency, and you **must** only do transactions with that currency mostly your entire life. On the other hand with crypto you can make your homework, and choose what ever project it fits you the most, and make your transactions with that given currency (thinking long term here). 

So anyways, just wanted to share a thought, I believe crypto it's way better than any government currency thinking long term, we will see massive adoption as time goes by, and people start realizing that they can now choose, what currency they can truly trust, and they can get out of that shady part of the system where they impose to them a given currency backed by armed forces and government power.

I recently realised that I had small crypto and have been reading r/cc recently. I thought I dsay hi and tell what it is to enter this world nowadays.

So I received around 356 XLM from stellar/keybase airdrop back in 2019. At that time it was worth penny and didn't bother. Recently I thought about BTC holders becoming rich and thought I should check on that. Hey, that's around 120€ now! Nothing crazy but free money is always welcome.

After reading a bit r/cc I decided to split it around 30% BTC, 30% eth and 30% alts. My plan is to see how far this free money can go.

So I discover crypto and man it's a wild world! Things I realised too late:

\- Exchange cost money. I lost quite some for stupid reasons in fees. 

\- Exchange have their rules and there are minimal withdrawal/conversion. For instance, I now have around 0.8 luna stuck forefer in Binance.

\- There is no good free software multy currency wallet outside browser. Closer one is [airgap-it](https://airgap.it/).

\- Atomic wallet seed phrase doesn't follow standards. One shouldn't use atomic wallet.

Just some maths: if you bought a whole ETH for 2000$ back in March, then let's say you sold half close to the top which is 4200$, you are now with 2100$ and 0.5 ETH.

Before I’ll begin I’ll say that I am new to crypto.
As of now that we are going through a big rise in the market I am always wondering how do I know when is it a good time to leave and take my funds?

As someone that could only afford 500$ to invest and do want to be able to gain more coins I would like to try to be able to make a little profits so I can gain from them more coins when they will go down again. How do I know when it’s a good time to exit even if it’s just for 1 day to be able to rebuy more coins when it’s lower? 

Thank you.",When should I exit,1633187762
2331,CryptoCurrency,Harleychillin93,"I know, I know, where was I a couple days ago, but hear me out.

Noone knows if btc will get another run up this cycle, but noone knows that we won't either. Calls for crypto winter were in full swing. IMO thats exactly why we surprised everyone, cause thats what btc does best, surprises. 

But after this last 24 hours in the green, I'm fucking jacked to the tits specifically for btc, and by the transitive nature of crypto, I am therefore bullishly jacked for the whole market.

Btc needed to stay above the golden cross to remain bullish, but the weekly macD was about to flip red. These are two strong opposing forces. Perfect example of indecisive, contradictory TA.

Then yesterday happened. +10% on BTC. That litterally never happens anymore, not on the green side, and not that often at least. This plants the price firmly above the golden cross, and more importantly, turned the macD around into positive growing, totally invalidating the bear case. 

Even just looking at price action, it was almost a bear market and this latest run turned it into a bear trap. 

The marginal cost of electric to mine 1 btc assuming you already have miners is ~20k a coin. That cost is what we've always long termed bottomed at, but I dont think that'll be the case this time. Tesla got in at 30k, you think other savvy ceos are going to let it go under 30? I think potentially we never see it go far under teslas buy in price because that's a clear valuation metric for anyone who doesn't really understand the tech. Elons price.

Not to mention price action from el Salvador had to be felt eventually. Its only a country formally adopting it. Now there's Twitter LN tips and AMC going to take a slew of different crypto. 

I never thought 60k was the top this cycle. I didnt sell a sat. Call me crazy, honestly I believe in the super cycle theory and its playing out perfectly. Until today, I didnt feel like I knew, I only felt, like 60k wasn't the top. Now I'm so fucking sure of it im making this post here to tell all of you.

Im so fucking bullish i can barely type. UPTOBER LFG! 60k wasn't the top this cycle, fucking quote me. Remind yourselves to come back and talk shit in 3-6 months. Toss a moon to your hopium dealer and stay classy out there.

Part of this is an implementation of where if you hit your carbon credit limit then you will but cut off from buying stuff. So if it detected you are trying to fly or buy gas, then you can't buy that ticket even if your job needs you in an area. A lot of the dealings are with the UN and other places.

Anyways, I've been wondering how would the carbon credit thing work at all. And then it hit me, it could be another crypto coin. Where basically its a stable coin but a reverse. Where they say this is the level we want carbon to be this is the max before we die. At the max make each coin value very little and when it's at the min make the coins value a lot.

2346,CryptoCurrency,JustGarate,"Listen. I'm not saying you should discard 2FA, absolutely not. 2FA is a MUST HAVE in the crypto world. However, it seems like a lot of you are using one of these two apps for your 2FA purposes, and I'm sorry to break it to you, but they're not the best ones out there.

Imagine a bad case scenario: you wake up, and your phone is completely broken, nothing works, it won't boot up. What now? You buy a new one, install your apps and done, right? Well, apparently Google Authenticator only has two ways of backing up your stuff, either you transfer it from your old phone to the new one (while both are functioning, of course), or there's this new alternative where you can export your 2FA stuff using QR codes...

...Yeah, leaving your 2FA data as an unencrypted QR code laying around on your gallery, computer or cloud doesn't sound very secure, right? Well, at least you decide where you want to save it, and the keys supposedly never leave your device, can't be 100% sure on that though.

Things are pretty different when it comes to Authy, everything is backed up all the time, how cool is that??? Until you realize it isn't cool at all. Your codes won't stay in your device, instead, Authy will be kind enough to hold your keys for you on their cloud, and never give you your data back, [here's a brief explanation](https://youtu.be/iXSyxm9jmmo?t=1146) (I'd suggest you to watch the entire video, I found it fascinating). 

""What should I use then?"" Well, [privacytools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/#2fa) has some good suggestions depending on the OS you use on your phone. I personally use Android and went with Aegis. Why Aegis? Let me explain.

[Aegis](https://getaegis.app/) (which btw, is completely open source) encrypts your keys, can be locked (I strongly recommend you to do it), your keys can be exported if you want to move to another app, or you can directly do Aegis backups LOCALLY! This is why I love the app. I can treat my data like it's my seed phrase. Everything gets saved in a convenient single JSON file you can store on your computer, USB drive, cloud (I wouldn't recommend this one unless you use a very private service like Icedrive or self-hosted server)... wherever. The only downside is I can't write it on a piece of paper and put it deep inside my drawer (or well, I technically can, but I won't).

I just hope you consider switching to a secure, open-source alternative when it comes to your 2FA. Remember, your keys should be completely yours, treat them like it's your seed phrase, don't give them out to assholes like Authy who want to stick you in their ecosystem. Always stay protected and make sure you are backing your stuff up, because anything could happen to your phone anytime. Trust me, my phone got stolen when I least expected it. Thanks for saving my ass, Aegis.",Why you should NOT use Authy or Google Authenticator,1633188182

There has been a huge influx of defi users lately. Uniswap is popping. Crypto is too big for the Chinese government to stop its people from investing. Good to see that the Chinese investors moved to defi rather than selling off.


Evergrande’s debt problem will continue to make headlines but you can ignore it. The Chinese government has decided to allow a slow bleed. At the same time, they are going to keep Evergrande afloat.

I had just installed the extension on my chrome browser but apparently I was the victim of phishing because about 30 mins after the money was gone. I lost about 1.1 in the form of 3 tokens.

All three transfers went to the same wallet address making me suspect it's also a Metamask wallet. I followed the wallet Address on Etherscan as you can see here in this link: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x6ba6e6a78c103e74bf6046d4021413e60e70e0bf](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6ba6e6a78c103e74bf6046d4021413e60e70e0bf)  


I noticed that that wallet doesn't have any outgoing transfers as of yet only incoming transfers. The latest inbound transfer show 8 eths which indicates this wallet is stealing people money non stop and it's probably adding up to a serious number.  
Is there anything that can be done to block this wallet from sending out transactions and perhaps reverse those transfer to the wallets they came from? Is there anything Metamask could do? or maybe something a heroic white hat hacker is able to pull off and basically hack the hackers?

Brave is a browser, it was co-founded by Brendan Eich, the CEO, who also previously co-founded Mozilla, and also created the language JavaScript while working at Netscape. I don't think there is a person who has made more of an impact to the web as he has. This is his 3rd browser war.

Brave has a privacy preserving model where you are in control of your data. They do not harvest any data about any of their users and don't want to. This lead to a unique problem/solution - advertising.

BAT is the token used by Brave in the Brave browser, to help distribute revenue from their ad program. Advertisers pay Brave, Brave uses 70% of the money to buy BAT off the market to distribute to users who opt into privacy preserving ads.


Here are a few interesting stats/facts/numbers.
1.5 billion total supply, basically all of it in circulation.
$1b market cap, ranked #102 on coingecko.


Currently over 20% of the userbase is opted into rewards. Over 38.9m monthly active users and 13.4 daily active users. About 7% growth this past month.

Brave's userbase has been more than doubling each year. They project 50 million end of year, but I believe they might fall short by a month or so. They're planning on ramping up marketing so I guess we'll see.

They're ve also been increasing ad buys. This past month over $2.4 million worth of BAT buys off the market to distribute from the ads rewards program. Up about 7x from this month last year.


Now for upcoming features.

Brave is adding a new wallet to their browser, lightweight to not impact performance, completely written in c++, without many of the problems of browser add on wallets. They intend for this to be a metamask killer. It will have support on multiple networks, NFT support, an easy fiat-crypto on ramp through Wyre, and a dex aggregator with a swap rewards program.

https://brave.com/swap-rewards-program/

What I'm most excited about this is the size of Brave's userbase in combination with their upcoming swap rewards program. There will be a 20% rebate, paid in BAT, for users who are opted into rewards off the .875% fee. This will be bought off the market by Brave at the end of each month and distributed. 

 If the dex eventually gets 1% of it's Brave's 38.9m users using it each month that would be 389k users. Something comparable was Uniswap in January - they had 300k users and 20 billion in volume.

*If* Braves dex agg got 20 Billion in volume that would be 35 million dollars in BAT rebates bought off the market, about **15x Braves current $2.4 m BAT buys for ads this month.**

Now I know adoption won't be instant but if it really is a meta mask killer - which is what the CEO said it was. I believe 389k users per month isn't a crazy number. Especially in a year when Brave may be approaching 100m monthly users.


A few other things that are exciting to me to that will eventually be coming out - paying for premium services with BAT such as Brave talk, Brave VPN/firewall, premium search features through Braves new search engine(in beta currently but works good).

There also planning on expanding their ads through a self serve platform, eventually. 

Also they want to add tipping to the newly launched Brave Talk, I made a post about what I think that could mean for Cam Models [here](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/BATProject/comments/pswt70/i_think_when_brave_talk_has_tips_added_could_be/).

First things first, obviously, there’s no risk of investing and being pumped and dumped. It’s free to invest in and earn, and that’s going to attract a large number of people.

The game itself is absurdly addicting and captures pretty much everything that makes a video game successful in the current environment: Battle Royale genre, stat-tracking, skill rankings, tournaments, and active developers constantly working on new game modes and an app. It’s also pretty simple, something that tends to make phone games really successful (think 2048, Candy Crush, etc).

In terms of performance, you can see [here](https://info.viper.exchange/token/0xfe1b516a7297eb03229a8b5afad80703911e81cb), looking at it’s all-time liquidity; it has very strong upwards trend and due to the reasons mentioned above, there’s no reason to think that’ll change any time soon as more people discover it and get hooked.

The currency itself you earn in-game is called ROYALE, or ROY (as you’ve already seen if you clicked the link above). It’s an HRC20 token created specifically for the game.

I know everybody is always looking for a coin to invest in while it’s still cheap. This game can absolutely be the first of its generation (free to play crypto games) to really blow up… don’t miss it y’all.

Trump and his wife announce that they have tested positive for covid. Cryptocurrency and Asian stock markets dump related to the news. 

ETH developers announce that they take a second attempt at a final Ethereum 2.0 Testnet after Spadina failed. 

U.S. Regulators and law enforcement officials bring charges against BitMEX exchange for facilitating unregistered trading. 

October 2, 2020 Crypto Prices:

BTC : $10,624.94
ETH : $353.22
BCH : $228.08
ADA : $0.097
LTC : $46.28 
XLM : $0.073

I simply wanted to look back and compare the states of the market after 1 year. I believe this month, and the remaining year will be strong for crypto. Maybe I am biased. But everyone should conduct their own research and manage their portfolios accordingly.

I felt so bad and what was worse, I had no control. I couldn’t stop this scammer. I’m compelled to write this post so you don’t have to deal with my imaginary pain. 

Here are my tips for the dreamers in this sub

1. Seed phrase never touches technology. If it’s digital technology forget about it. Be creative when storing phrases.

2. Buy a cheap phone and add a copy of google authenticator on it. A back up phone could save you.

3.Email only for Crypto. Don’t mix pleasure and business. 

4. Only buy your crypto, no one is giving out anything for free. It’s a scam bro!

5. For anyone pushing you for information such as friends or coworkers, you only own doge and your down 50%.

Curious to know what is your story and how you chance upon Crypto or how has Crypto change your life ? 

I will start with my story. I am an ordinary person, living from paycheck to paycheck. I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world ( Fun fact: It is one of Vitalik’s favourite city ), there is no way I can have extra money to pamper myself or my family in the foreseeable future.

I want my money to work harder for me but don’t have enough capital to invest in shares or have the financial know-how. Getting into Crypto is the first time I see hope, that there might be a possibility, however slight, that I can earn financial freedom in the future. The chance that I can make my $1 into $10 or more. 

My story with Crypto. I first heard about Bitcoin in 2009-2011. At that time Bitcoin can only be mined and/or was beyond my means to purchase. Then Not sure how, years just flew and it is Aug 2021. This time, I finally begin my Crypto journey. 

What I love about Crypto is it is easy and affordable to get into. One does not need a lot of capital although, like most things, it will be easier if you have big money to start. It is also easy to start an account and start investing. 

Of course it is not perfect with its volatility. But it is this volatility that makes the the possibility of gaining bigger. I feel the best time to make big money with little investment has already gone but I still hoping for a decent accumulation. Also, I only invest what I can afford to lose hence no big deal.

No your gpu won't get weaker and weaker

No Its not gonna be dead within a week

of course all of this depends on having a decent air flow in your Pc

and of course it depends on you electrical bill but [In general, mining Ethereum is still profitable as long as your electricity cost is somewhere around $0.15 and your GPU has a decent hash rate, think GTX 1070 or better](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/can-you-still-earn-money-mining-ethereum-3f5d56758823).

How do I start?

the easiest way is unminable. you can mine with Cpu and Gpu, you can get paid in a lot of different coins but they get 1%, generally if you are too lazy this is the option for you.

if you don't want to lose that 1% I suggest installing phoenix Miner, and setting up a pool.

what is a mining pool? is the pooling of resources by miners, who share their processing power over a network. basically unless you have a huge huge setup, You can't work without it.

what are some of the best pools?

personally after trying many of them ethermine (1% fee ) and nicehash (2% fee ) are by far the best pools, personally I like Ethermine more.

its gonna be while before you get paid. you can use this [https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator](https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator) to determine your profits. and this site to see your electrical cost (USD/kWh) if you live in USA [https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm\_table\_grapher.php?t=epmt\_5\_6\_a](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a) .

if you find the fan annoying you can use MSI Afterburner for nvidia gpu's

it also can be uses for pushing you card to limit (overclocking)

now lets look at some basic profit even at the highest electrical cost (0.2 usd/kwh)

1060:1.14 USD / Day

1070:1.40 USD / Day

2060 super: 2.25 USD / Day

2080ti: 3.01 USD / Day

3090: 6.49 USD / Day

TLDR: if you have a gpu higher than 1060 use it for mining, it is profitable even at the worst case  scenario.","if you have an gaming Pc, start mining now.",1633099457

Hi, I am new to Reddit and crypto and am looking for some insight from you experienced folks on what I should/can do with the new crypto management wallet I just finished setting up, MetaMask.

I only started using Reddit in February since I lightly trade stocks and wanted to be part of the fun on Wall Street Bets, which turned over to Superstonk. 

I am waiting for the Mother Of All Short Squeezes to shoot my GME stocks into galaxies far far away, but since there is the possibility of an “Non-Fungible Token” based stock dividend being released at some unknown time in the future, I read about the different options available for the platforms used to store the dividend if/when it is released to shareholders such as myself. 

So I have MetaMask set up and it has a 0 account balance, my stock portfolios total XX shares of GME stock, and I am a broke college fuck so I cannot exactly trade crypto currencies like I hear about all the time. What else can I do with my newfound financial platform? Am I able to earn crypto currency like I see advertised, or are those ‘EARN CRYPTO BY DOING X…” advertisements a scam? I feel almost as if having this crypto wallet gave me computer hacker superpowers. 

I’d hate to waste anyone’s time with my noob nonsense, so please don’t feel burdened with this inquiry. If anyone can spare the time to send some crypto pointers my way, I will greatly appreciate it.

I've been using Binance since the first day I started crypto. It was easy to transfer money to the exchange, plenty to choose from and the UI was clear. Overall it started as a pleasant experience.


But since then;


Deposit methods stopped, with zero communication 


Tried to move XMR to a dedicated wallet: suspended for unknown time with zero communication.


Tried to move ONE to a dedicated wallet: suspended for 7 days with zero communication


Algo Governance starts: withdrawals suspended till entry for Governance stops. Again, zero communication.


All I had left on Binance was my staked Eth, I really liked the trade to buy bEth for 0.95Eth and trade it back 1:1, it would mean free money and staking rewards.


I made mistakes in my journey, tried to speak to customer service but the change to get hit by lightning is higher than speaking to customer service. Holy moly, there's like two parttime employees max I think. 


Yesterday something snapped, I've seen it happen to Monero and One before but now with Algo. That's a low thing to do. Like, really, trust is a valuable thing in this world and I ignored the FUD around Binance for a long time but this was the final straw I needed.

As someone who only got into crypto this year, this classic criminal scum line is one of the most frequently ""arguments"" I get told.

So I did a little research to check if it's true.

Spoiler: it's not.

#An investigative report that debunks this exact thing was already conducted in February 2021

It was covered by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/haileylennon/2021/01/19/the-false-narrative-of-bitcoins-role-in-illicit-activity/), [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/crypto-council-for-innovation-report%3A-criminals-will-move-away-from-bitcoin-2021-04-13), [Business Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/how-an-ex-cia-director-proved-bitcoin-use-in-crime-is-declining-10013473), [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/concern-over-btc-illicit-finance-153000997.html), and other places. 

The report was led by Michael Morell, former deputy director of the CIA. 

Here are some of its findings that you can hopefully to lessen the amount of ignorance about crypto:

1. Only **less than 1%** of all crypto activity was used for illicit activities from 2017-2020
2. For Bitcoin specifically, illicit activity makes up **less than 0.5%** of total transaction volume
3. Money laundering through cryptocurrencies remain relatively small compared to the volumes of cash laundered through traditional methods (fiat)
4. Illicit activity in the global economy that are overwhelmingly conducted through traditional banks and with fiat are on the order of 2 to 4 per-cent of global GDP
5. Blockchains are a powerful forensic tool and it is easier for law enforcement to trace illicit activity using Bitcoin than it is to trace cross-border illegal activity using traditional banking transactions, and far easier than cash transactions

Bonus trivia: Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency most used in illicit activity, but XMR (Monero) is used more often for illicit purposes as a share of their total transactions.","What can you say when you get told the ""Only criminals use btcoin!!"" line?",1633101490

Can they even deposit that much in fiat currency? I think Binance helds a daily deposit limit of $250,000. This means that to invest $1Bn they’d have to make one transaction every day, until they reach to day 4000th!",How Do Billionaires Invest in Bitcoin?,1633101552

2463,CryptoCurrency,Anthemz,"I consider myself slightly graduating from beginner to novice in the Crypto world, and as I learn more and more about the Crypto space it got the wheels turning more in what specific exchanges / wallets I’d like to invest from. I know Wealthsimple is not commonly liked or approved around here as it isn’t a platform where you have an actual wallet address to trade Crypto. It is strictly a buy and sell, and you don’t necessarily even own the Crypto itself, it’s more like an ‘IOU’ from Wealthsimple. 

But for a novice in Crypto who is currently only in it for financial gains, at least right now, is that so bad? I started investing with Wealthsimple, although I do have other Crypto assets on other exchanges and wallets. My desire is to allocate all of my assets to one platform so I am not constantly flipping between multiple apps. 

I wanted to withdraw all my funds from WS and move them to my NDAX exchange so I could have my freedom in having an actual wallet address and owning the Crypto, but as a beginner investor I fear that exchanges and wallets are more prone to theft or breaches. As much scrutiny as there is for Wealthsimple, I feel like Wealthsimple probably provides the best security and is the most ‘safe’. I also could be wrong in my assumptions and for wanting to keep my assets on a non-tradable app but I guess what I am asking is, if you’re only in Crypto for financial investing/earning money, is it that bad to be using or Wealthsimple or should I honestly migrate to an exchange/wallet for other reasons I am not seeing right now? Any insight would be great as I’m still learning and trying to navigate this world.",Is Wealthsimple really all that bad for Crypto investing?,1633101866

I've been here for all of about three seconds and I'm already thinking, ""damn, I should be more thoughtful about my security."" I'm using Coinbase at the moment, any thoughts on how I can be more vigilant? 

Forgive my beginner's poor comprehension of what I'm seeing on this sub. I've seen users indicating that 2FA is bad, and I'm guessing what they're pointing to is that it just isn't strong enough (because the info used for 2FA is too easy for people to get a hold of I suppose?) What can I do that's better than that? I'd rather be careful about all of this before I'm in deep enough to feel like everything hangs in the balance. I'm not familiar with hardware wallets, but I'm open? ...

2470,CryptoCurrency,crua9,"I will be referencing to this [https://i.imgur.com/lW7zGsD.png](https://i.imgur.com/lW7zGsD.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Basically right now we are in a tight area and there is still indications showing we will blast off to $100k or more by the end of the year. But a big thing needs to be noted.

1. We need to get beyond the $50k mark and be stable. To do this we simply need more volume in buying vs selling. So if you want to help, then hold or buy (not financial advice). 
2. If this hits below $40k then there is a high likely we might see it go sub $30k. Most likely sub $25k. **Basically we are in a make it or die moment.** There just isn't enough data to say which way the wind is going to blow. It's more up to if the investor firms and banks. But if we get to $100k it's possible to go all the way up to $150k with retail investor momentum. Just note the dip after.

Anyways, we should have enough data next week. What I'm looking for is if it's like in the blue circles or pink. Where if it drops overnight (which I seriously doubt), will it drop slightly maybe with bumps to get to today's peak, or will it skyrocket. Day by day we might flat line again. But based on everything, next week is the make or break moment. 

But between every time the USA had threats of a gov shutdown and it rocketed up, timing, past data I believe there is more of a lean to rocket (which is why I bought more crypto the last 2 or 3 days.

&amp;#x200B;

Please note, IMO if this does rocket up. It's highly likely Dec, Jan, or Feb will be bloody.  I don't think we will touch this price level again. But if it does go to $100k+ it's likely we might see it drop over night basically to $70k or $60k. For long term holders this is healthy. But short term you need to note this. Look up DCA

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you with newer coins that has projects going on. You can use this to help build hype for your coin. IMO it's smart to not give any big big news until we are after a stable $50k. What happens in the blue circles can happen still. But IMO it should be smart to give smaller news (basically if it's a major feature you want to announce and the price drops like what I'm seeing. Then you don't want to tie the image of your news to the drop. But if you tie it to jumping then that makes more hype into itself and gets more people onboard with the idea of the feature. Where if it's small news it's too short lived to matter. But your already holders will most likely be more hype and understanding.) But for all coins if it does drop off a cliff be prepared PR wise to deal with that to lower the fall out. That or just be prepared in general.",Here's some TA to show we are on a massive swing,1633102099
2473,CryptoCurrency,Fun_Inflation_5129,"My hypothesis and I’m surprised no one is thinking of it os the following 
1) many companies who are quietly buying up coin on their portfolios are in either spending remaining funds they didn’t use if they are on a calendar year financial calendar … or if their fiscal year ends Q3 then they have fresh funds to commit going into Q4

2) Retail investors like myself start to get better year end bonuses and gifts that I plan to instantly convert to coin.  For regular folk like me that won’t really move the needle but think about all those Wall Street guys getting millions in bonuses and looking to reinvest. 

3) Americans tend to start thinking about taxes and trying to either take profits or harvest losses

2474,CryptoCurrency,gustavossj,"Since we support crypto, anywhere can be a good entry point. Crypto will go up, down, and even sideways, but it will go higher most of the times. If we think about it, we are a small part of society which is a part of something greater. Many people don't even have crypto, which seems mind blowing. 

So if we don't worry about the entry point, then everything will be good. We can buy high and still do better than those who have no crypto. The only thing that matters is getting into crypto regardless of the entry. If we give it some time, then buying at the ATH will mean little in the long run since it will recover. 

Even if it doesn't recover, we are still a part of something few people will embrace in our lifetime. It doesn't matter that much when we buy, but if we buy.

When did you realize that Shitcoins have close to no future?

What projects gained your attention, that you decided to stay loyal to?

Personal I learned a lot, looked up the technologies, looked up projects, and I just laugh when I think back I thought that doge was a best choice.

2489,CryptoCurrency,pm_me_cute_sloths_,"The new iPhone released last week and with Black Friday in a couple months we’re getting into the peak part of the year for people getting new phones (or so I would assume).

Before you even think about moving everything over to that fancy new phone of yours, double and triple check that *all* of your wallet passphrases are stored securely and that you can find them.

I understand that almost everyone here has theirs stored away and everything, I did too, but double check. There’s a high probability you will need it since you’re moving everything to a new device so you’ll need to recover your wallet on the new phone.

I didn’t realize this when I got my new phone and I assumed I had everything backed up in my safe in the event I needed it, as I have been pretty religious about writing that stuff down. 

Well, I went to go to check my ALGO balance and commit them to governance and it needed my passphrase. Turns out, I did not place my passphrase where I typically do and thought I lost all my ALGO because I stupidly somehow didn’t write the phrase down. I ripped apart my apartment and eventually found it thankfully, but it was terrifying

So don’t be like me and actually verify you have everything written down before you do something that almost certainly will require you to restore with those pass phrases. Use this as a sign to double check that all you can find all of yours.","Important: Before you factory reset your old phone, be sure to triple check you have the passphrase for your crypto stored safely",1633102989

Anyway, my coin/token would be called Carbon \[CRBN\]. I'd imagine that it's use case would be that individuals/organisations would put down a certain amount of collateral down (be it fiat/stable/crypto) which would go towards funding and developing carbon offsetting technologies such as new renewable energies. In return for doing so, they would receive an equivalent amount of CRBN to their collateral, which can be used to generate ""clean"" passive income, vote on which technologies current and new funding should be directed towards, as well as other things that I haven't fully fleshed out yet.

2500,CryptoCurrency,leo13mg,"Hey guys,   
I was studying ADA and found it to be a in a very bullish point, the coin has been through a correction phase lately, quite stable I would say, and now is in a strong support point. The project is quite bright and the developers are acting to find more partners and uses for their coin, their summit has many strategic partners and their ecological project is quite nice.  
The region the price is now is quite a strong support, the price has acted very well in the past, around 1.9$, using Fibonacci retracement we find the price at 50% of the retracement, quite strong support for the price. BTC is also in a similar position, if the price goes up in BTC, ADA will surely take off this time, players are quite fearful with cryptos, but ADA is a great opportunity at this point.

[Price found a strong support around 1.9$ with the Fibonacci retracement and past price action in this point](https://preview.redd.it/z5acrahlinq71.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66e89b6cf96f0fbe92d578730b39fdfd45501a63)

At 50% of Fibonacci retracement and the price support of 1.9$ the coin is looking good to enter for those looking to a more stable coin with great project. The volume is decreasing together with the selling movement and the MACD is quite stable after the drop, signaling a possible bottom for the correction and new opportunity for a bullish movement from now on. At this point I would be comfortable enough to  draw a projection to the price, looking for a price target for a renewed buyer movement.

[Using the Fibonacci projection to find a new price target for a bullish movement, the target is around 4$ if this support allows a new buyer movement from now on.](https://preview.redd.it/tunu5yjgjnq71.png?width=2557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=873c154e8c8460a1cf734442d8a159e0cf1e3937)

If we are to believe that this point now is a support, a new bullish movement would have the price target at around 4$ using the Fibonacci projection. This coin has a good project and is quite believable that it can reach this price, BTC is also in a very similar movement, if the crypto market heats again this coin is a stable and reliable opportunity for those who want to put in a stable part of their crypto wallet.  
What do you think about Cardano, is it a good opportunity? Do you have it on your wallet? Tell me more about it, what is the price target for you? Let's talk more about it!","ADA is looking very bullish at this support, ready to take off? Cardano could be a good option!",1633013030

As we can see it is really tough to accumulate such karma.The top contributor with 15000 karma could actually lead a luxurious life in china, a moderate life in india including rent and a students life in pretty much anywhere.  

Seeing that such getting such moons this distribution is highly unlikely to a normal comment once in a while Redditor. I have calculated the number of moons u need to live off on Ramen 3 times a day 31 days(October) of the month.

*( the first unit is the avg cost of a single serving of instant ramen (packet, cup, etc.))*

**USA: 0.35\*3\*31 = 32.55 USD/ 216.14 moons**

**China: 0.1\*3\*31 = 9.3 USD/ 61.75 moons** 

**Japan: 0.96\*3\*31 = 89.28 USD/ 592.84 moons**

**Germany: 0.35\*3\*31 = 32.55 USD / 216.14 moons**

**UK: 0.5\*3\*31= 46.5 USD / 308.77 moons** 

**India:  0.13\*3\*31= 12.09 USD / 80.28 moons** 

**France: 0.35\*3\*31= 32.55 USD / 216.14 moons**

**Italy: 1.06\*3\*31= 98.58 USD/ 654.60 moons** 

**Canada: 0.37\*3\*31= 34.41 USD / 228.49 moons**

**South korea: 0.59\*3\*31 = 54.87 USD / 364.35 moons**

On the ramen index, Italy ranks as the most expensive country for a ramen lover. And as usual, china takes the cake by being the least expensive. This gets me to wonder if the Chinese FUD and Chinese government banning crypto is actually a Bogandoff move to make Chinese wojak's suffer.

Now, the only problem was when the pandemic hit, my brain could not fathom how the finances of the world would work when there is no more bitcoin to mine to help people with finances who have lost jobs. I started seeing mayhem and then i woke up with a start. 

That made me write this post and get my question answered:

how would the world economics deal with catastrophic events if crytpo/bitcoin were to become global currency considering that there is a limit to it. I understand that the value of bitcoin would explode when such catastrophic events happen but then so would the price of every good that is generated in the market e.g. bread, water, gas etc. In such scenarios, if someone loses job and stops earning satoshis, would there be anything helping that person with bail offs?

WonderFi Technologies Inc. (NEO: WNDR) (OTC: WONDF) (the ""**Company**"" or ""**WonderFi**"") today announced that it has established and deployed proof of stake (PoS) validator nodes on the Ethereum network, as part of its continued decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure and portfolio management strategy.

""Validator nodes play a crucial role in securing the networks that power DeFi, while providing yield on the staked assets"" commented Cong Ly, CTO of WonderFi. Currently staking ETH through a validator node yields approximately 6% APY on the staked assets.

Blockchain protocols that use PoS consensus mechanisms are supported by validator nodes that play a critical role in securing the network and validating transactions. PoS requires participants to stake ETH to become a validator on the network. Validators are responsible for ordering transactions and creating new blocks, earning block rewards in return for providing this work.

The Company will deploy best practices in managing, updating and operating its validator nodes, and evaluate the performance and potential for additional PoS-related opportunities across relevant networks that power decentralized finance.

 

**ABOUT WONDERFI**

WonderFi is a leading technology company with the mission of creating better access to DeFi through the core principles of simplicity and education. WonderFi has a multi-pronged business strategy which includes a high-growth consumer finance app which will serve as a trusted gateway to the new financial system, and a digital asset portfolio which consists of leading crypto and DeFi assets. WonderFi's executive team and Board of Directors have an established track record in finance and crypto, with previous experience at Amazon, Shopify, PayPal, Galaxy Digital, Hut 8 and BIGG Digital. WonderFi's core team of engineers and technologists believe that everyone should have equal access to finance, and are aligned in the mission to empower people around the world to access DeFi in a simple, smart and secure way.

2622,CryptoCurrency,fightforthefuture,"*TL;DR: The House is scheduled to vote on the infrastructure bill this Thursday 9/30. This is a crucial opportunity to get as many lawmakers on the record in support of a #DontKillCrypto fix as possible. Contact your reps at* [***DontKillCrypto.com***](http://dontkillcrypto.com/#scoreboard)[***/#scoreboard***](http://dontkillcrypto.com/#scoreboard)

This Thursday, September 30, is when the House plans to vote on an infrastructure package the Senate already passed. Buried inside the package are unworkable cryptocurrency provisions that [**threaten the rights of software developers**](https://decrypt.co/78530/irs-wont-go-after-bitcoin-miners-regardless-broker-definition-reports) and [**undermine human rights and free expression.**](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/cryptocurrency-surveillance-provision-buried-infrastructure-bill-disaster-digital)

This harmful provision led to major political action in the decentralized tech community, driving unprecedented numbers of calls to lawmakers that resulted in a heroic, bipartisan effort to get it fixed. Despite overwhelming support, the Amendment failed at the last minute, basically due to a process technicality related to obscure Senate rules. But now, we have a huge opportunity to get more lawmakers on the record in support of policies protecting cryptocurrency innovation, privacy, and human rights. 

At this point we are unlikely to affect the outcome of the broader infrastructure package vote, but the good news is that both Democrats and Republicans in the House have already said they want to take common sense action similar to [**the Wyden amendment**](https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-lummis-toomey-amendment-would-clarify-digital-asset-reporting-requirements) to fix the provision. So, we need to demand that everyone voting on the infrastructure bill also publicly commits to helping fix the crypto provision. They can do so by issuing a statement, tweeting #DontKillCrypto like [**Rep Khanna**](https://twitter.com/rokhanna/status/1423760775131418627), or signing a letter like the one from [**Rep Eshoo**](https://decrypt.co/78387/anna-eshoo-pelosi-letter-crypto-tax-bill) or from [**Reps Emmer, Soto, David, and Foster**](https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1424845416697323522). 

Here’s what to do:

**EVERYONE:** Use our scoreboard at [**DontKillCrypto.com/#scoreboard**](http://dontkillcrypto.com/#scoreboard) to see if your rep has made a public commitment. If they haven’t, use our easy tools to contact your rep now. If they reply to you, help us keep the scorecard current by emailing [**Team@FightForTheFuture.org**](mailto:Team@FightForTheFuture.org). Then, make sure your friends and collaborators do the same by the morning of September 30.

**IF YOU RUN A PROJECT, CHANNEL, OR SOCIAL ACCOUNT WITH REACH:** Drive traffic to [**DontKillCrypto.com**](http://dontkillcrypto.com/#scoreboard) — ask your audience to take 5 minutes to find their representative on the scoreboard and contact them before the vote. Activate mailing lists, go live, and ask that in this crucial moment the crypto community makes their voices heard.

This is a golden opportunity to get our reps on the record. Once they join the momentum for a bipartisan fix, our reps are committed to moving that fix forward either through a future budget bill, or standalone legislation. The crypto coalition can grow, and that’s what we need for a decentralized future. ",Here is the plan to get lawmakers on the record opposing the bad cryptocurrency provisions in the infrastructure bill,1632927426

## Ethereum

Ethereum fell by 4.12% on Tuesday. Following a 4.40% slide on Monday, Ethereum ended the day at $2,805.65.

A mixed start to the day saw Ethereum rise to an early morning intraday high $2,971.16 before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $3,087, Ethereum slid to a final hour intraday low $2,782.60.

Ethereum fell through the first major support level at $2,844 to end the day at $2,805 levels.

At the time of writing, Ethereum was down by 0.22% to $2,799.58. A mixed start to the day saw Ethereum rise to an early morning high $2,828.00 before falling to a low $2,785.06.

Ethereum left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

### For the day ahead

Ethereum would need to move through the $2,853 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $2,924 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break back through to $2,900 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Tuesday’s high $2,971.16 would likely cap the upside.

In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Ethereum could test resistance at $3,100 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $3,042.

Failure to move through the $2,853 pivot would bring the 38.2% FIB of $2,740 and the first major support level at $2,735 into play.

Barring another extended sell-off, however, Ethereum should steer clear of sub-$2,700 levels. The second major support level sits at $2,665.

2664,CryptoCurrency,A_scandinavian,"I recently started trading crypto and here is how I have done goofed and lost some of my holdings:

**Fuck up nr.1: Forget your 2FA back-up password**

Title speaks for itself, I recently downloaded authy on my desktop to better safe-guard myself against any potential mishaps happening with my phone where I currently have authy, all fine and dandy. But since I had backed up my tokens on the phone with a password I needed to write this when setting up the authy desktop app. However, I had forgotten this password since I used a ""paper-wallet"" that I couldn't find. So I didn't really do much more regarding this secondary authy app and just let it sit.

Initially I didn't really care about this since I had my phone and authy was working on it, so everything was fine.

Enter..

**Fuck up nr.2: Phone is destroyed**

So yeah, title speaks for itself again. I lost my phone into the sink and everything got properly fucked from that point onward. I didn't have my functioning 2FA anymore, which meant.. all my crypto was inaccessible! \*Panic mode initiated\*

I had to start scrambling to contact my respective wallet / account companies / projects to try and regain control of my accounts. 

Luckily, and I say this with every meaning of the word, the majority of my holdings was in a CeFI-company (centralized finance) which meant that almost all my crypto was recovered after resetting my 2FA by contacting them \*phew\*. So in this ONE instance, centralization was a good thing for me personally. But only this one time.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I still lost a good chunk of my crypto which will never be recovered and is now locked-up in a wallet for good. The coldest of cold wallets, a dead one.

So don't do what I did, here is my advice to my future self:

*  Write down your passwords on multiple locations, preferrably on a rock tablet.
* Try and make the password memorable so that you don't need a piece of paper to remember it (mine was too complicated to memorize)
* Set up two 2FA accounts today while you still can!! 
* When setting up 2FA initially save the QR-code somewhere safe so that you can access the account at a later date with a new device without having the initial 2FA (I didn't do this, sadly...).

# What is it?

Axie Infinity is a videogame based on collecting ""cute monsters"" (idk how to name them XD) to fight with. The game runs on the Ethereum blockchain with the help of Ronin, a sidechain that helps minimizing fees and transaction delays. It mainly focuses on turn-based battles, both against computer-controlled Axie teams and against live opponents over the Internet.  Game items are represented by non-fungible NFTs or tokens. These cryptographically unique tokens can be linked to digital content; in the case of Axie Infinity, the Axies and the plots of land that populate the game. Unlike conventional game items, the NFT gives ownership to the buyer; you can trade Axies on the game market for real money. You can buy and sell Axies on the game market. You can also breed Axies, which allows you to build potentially more powerful teams and produce additional NFTs to sell on the market. Some Axie NFTs have sold up to 300 ETH each, or more than $ 600,000 at the time of this writing.

# How does it work?

Within the Axie Infinity universe, there are two main ways in which players can earn money. The first is by playing and earning Smooth Love Potions, or SLPs. The second is by breeding and selling Axies. **Smooth Love Potion (SLP):** SLPs are in-game rewards that are collected by players simply by playing. This makes them the easiest way to earn money through gaming. They can be earned through completing challenges or battles. Once enough SLPs are accumulated, they can be sold for real money.  Each SLP is represented by an ERC-20 token, which allows them to be traded and traded for free through the Ethereum blockchain. Each token has a real dollar value due to their requirement for breeding Axies within the game. Players wishing to breed Axies need a certain amount of SLP to do so. This gives SLPs intrinsic value. In Axie Infinity, SLPs can be earned like this:

* Adventure Mode: players are rewarded with SLP by battling monsters in adventure mode. Axies also earn experience points required to level up. An Axie level will determine how many SLPs have been won at the end of each battle. A maximum of 100 SLP per day can be earned in Adventure Mode.
* Arena: the Arena is a multi-player platform where players can battle with each other. Each player must increase his matchmaking score (MMR) to earn more SLPs for each win. Players can earn unlimited SLPs in Arena mode.
* Daily missions: these are challenges built into the platform that incentivize players to keep playing. These include winning a set number of battles per day or simply logging into the game once per day for a set period.

**The Axie Infinity Shards**, or AXS, are the native and governance tokens for the Axie Infinity platform. Introduced in November 2020, they allow every token holder to vote on decisions such as platform development or fund distribution. Axie Infinity's future intention is to become a fully decentralized organization that is run by players only.  The AXS token is also crucial for the Community Treasury. Community Treasury collects 100% of all transaction fees that occur on the platform. By staking AXS tokens and supporting the ecosystem, AXS holders can earn a share of the transaction fees collected. This incentivizes community support and further grows the Axie Infinity ecosystem.  According to the Axie website, AXS can also be earned within the game. However, the potential for pure play-to-earn is not yet fully available.  Like Smooth Love Potions (SLPs), AXS are also Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens. However, while SLPs have an unlimited supply that will constantly fluctuate according to the number of players, AXS’s current supply is set at 270 million.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallets for AXS are MyEtherWallet, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

2671,CryptoCurrency,vastlywealthy,"So when it comes to cashing out from a non KYC account, the only way I know how to do it is by transferring your holdings to a KYC then to your bank. 

So my concern is what if I used a non KYC account. I then proceeded by cashing out roughly 25% of my profits. The remaining 75% of my profits I used the same non KYC to buy a different coin that I’m just hodling. So I’m definitely going to report the 25% for taxes. In regards to the 75%, what if worst case scenario the newly purchased coin goes to 0. Since I obviously wouldn’t be cashing out, would I move on like it never happened?

I guess ultimately my question is, do I pay the taxes for the 75% profits for this coming tax year, or wait until I cash out of the new coin? And if I pay these taxes for this coming tax year, and my newly acquired coin decides to tank and get regulated off the market, would I just accept the substantial loss of what I paid from the taxes?

Since I left school a couple years back, I've been forced into a lifestyle of having to go and do things that I can't particularly be bothered with, in exchange for money which I have now come to rely on as a means to keep a roof over my head and food in my mouth.

This normally involves waking up at a time earlier than I want, going through the routine of brushing my teeth, having a shower and leaving for work. This is where I have to spend sometimes up to 8 hours performing tasks that I would rather not be doing for the interests of my bosses. I get paid only once a month and then have to work for a whole other month before I see more money.

I don't want to do that anymore, and so I've started investing my money into crypto hoping that it will pay off so that I don't have to suffer this life of working for a living. All I want is enough money to never have to worry about having to work and so that I can afford to buy all of the things that I want to have.

Other generations had it really easy by comparison - my parents are nearing retirement now and they're basically going to get paid by the government to sit on their ass doing nothing. They've paid off their mortgage now and live for free, and are now basically telling me I have to move out of the basement. They are very selfish people.

I'm not one of these ""lambo"" types, I would be happy with a high end brand new Range Rover, full package. My mansion doesn't have to have a tennis court but I will need a pool.

I just feel like crypto is my only hope, and if it doesn't pay off then I'm going to be really miserable for the rest of my life and I will probably die of polio or some other poor person disease from Victorian times.","I don't mean to sound dramatic, but if crypto doesn't make me a billionaire I will literally die.",1632929842

It is game called - Sorare. It is built on Ethereum, based on collectible NFT-s. Basically you can build your team, trade players, participate in tournaments and get rewards which you can exchange for money..

Point is that you can collect those NFT’s, each player has one and it’s price depends on players real life form (like on any Fantasy). Game collects player live data from platform - Opta, which can guarantee transparency. 

All player cards can be bought/sold either on auction or directly from other user and also you can get them by winning a tournament or just by reaching high rank in weekly/monthly statistics..

2736,CryptoCurrency,j0-hn-dea-ux,"Proof of work is a block consensus algorithm (how the blockchain comes to an agreement) which is utilised by coins like BTC LTC XMR ERGO ETH1.0. With POW your computer is racing to solve complex equations faster than any competition, this is why a more expensive computer and/or computer specifically purposed for mining will be more profitable and why it can make sense for miners to group together in 'mining pools'. 

Most POW blockchains are written so that as the total number of miners grows (tracked by total network hashrate) these equations will become harder to solve/discover so that blocks can maintain a desirable alloted period of time before another is found, which unfortunately leads again to expensive miners and mining pools finding and adding the majority of blocks to the chain.

Mining pools are when groups of computers combine their power and share the answers with eachother so that as a collective they can increase their chances of mining a block and earning the block rewards + transaction (tx) fees. This can be great for miners to average out the rewards they earn in a more sustainable manner but not so great for decentralisation of the network as in theory this would mean 1 or more mining pools could collude to perform a 51% attack and double spend their coins ( you can find this explained [here](https://platonworld.org/platonworld/blockchain-explained-how-a-51-attack-works-double-spend-attack/)).


Proof of stakes key difference is that as opposed a block producer is chosen at random and other validator nodes (computers securing the network similarly to miners) must attest to and agree that the block looks as it should and nothing fishy is going on, Validators and it's delegates are then rewarded with tokens for both of these processes. There is often a minimum stake requirement to run a validator node partially to ensure good behaviour of the node given that 'slashing' (loss of tokens) takes place for bad behaviour on most Blockchains.

Delegators however usually have no minimum requirements and require no more hardware than it took you to buy the coins in the first place. You can then delegate (lend) your coins to a Validator so that they share some of the profits with you, all of this without the coins ever leaving your wallet meaning that you always have possession of the private keys to your assets.

Because bad actors exist and because you risk your own delegated coins being slashed (taken by the network) you should research the validator you stake with and take into consideration diversifying your stake to multiple validators. Different validators will also offer your varying levels of rewards (in the form of a %APY) for staking with them.

There is also still a risk of a 51% attack on POS blockchains however it would require far more upfront capital to perform an attack since they must control a large enough % of total staked coins, and due to this there is less incentive to perform an attack since it would likely also crash the value of the asset also making their holdings less valuable and so it makes more economical sense for them to secure the network and protect their value rather than attack it and risk their value.

POS is also well recognised as being better for the environment due to the fact that it uses far less electricity than its POW counterpart. 

For more reading you can look [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/) and read up on ETH 2.0 at the same time, 2 for the time of 1.

There is also multiple types of POS like D-POS (delegated proof of stake) as mentioned above, such as Solana's POH which timestamps txs to order them correctly and you can read more about that [here](https://solana.com/news/proof-of-history---a-clock-for-blockchain), and Harmony's E-POS (effective proof of stake) which has election cycles for its validators which you can find more about [here](https://blog.harmony.one/introducing-harmonys-effective-proof-of-stake-epos/).",The difference between proof of work (POW) and proof of stake (POS),1632841884

Ethereum slid by 4.40% on Monday. Partially reversing a 4.68% gain from Sunday, Ethereum ended the day at $2,925.27.

A mixed start to the day saw Ethereum rise to an early morning intraday high $3,168.03 before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $3,205, Ethereum slid to a late intraday low $2,925.00.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $2,829, however, Ethereum ended the day at $2,925 levels.

At the time of writing, Ethereum was up 0.24% to $2,932.38. A mixed start to the day saw Ethereum fall to an early morning low $2,905.68 before rising to a high $2,932.38.

### For the day ahead

Ethereum would need to move through the $3,006 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $3,087 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break back through to $3,050 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Monday’s high $3,168.03 would likely cap the upside.

In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Ethereum could test resistance at the 23.6% FIB of $3,369 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $3,249.

Failure to move through the $3,006 pivot would bring the first major support level at $2,844 into play.

Barring another extended sell-off, however, Ethereum should steer clear of sub-$2,700 levels. The second major support level at $2,763 and the 38.2% FIB of $2,740 should limit the downside.

### For the day ahead

Litecoin would need to move through the $148 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $152 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Litecoin to break back through to $150 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Monday’s high $154.97 would likely cap the upside.

In the event of another breakout, Litecoin could test resistance at $160 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $158.

Failure to move through the $148 pivot would bring the first major support level at $142 into play.

Ripple’s XRP would need to move through the $0.9415 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $0.9626 into play.

Support would be needed, however, for Ripple’s XRP to break out from $0.95 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Monday’s high $0.98166 would likely cap the upside.

In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP could test the second major resistance level at $1.0028.

Failure to move through $0.9415 pivot would bring the first major support level at $0.9013 into play.

Barring an extended sell-off, however, Ripple’s XRP should avoid the 23.6% FIB of $0.8533. The second major support level at $0.8802 should limit the downside.

&gt;The guidance was written for those ‘engaging in the offer, sale, or distribution of a digital asset.’ The framework discusses the Howey test prongs: a) the investment of money; b) the existence of a common enterprise; c) a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others.   
&gt;  
&gt;For example, the guidance explains that when a crypto network is ‘still in development, the network or digital asset is not fully functional. Therefore, purchasers would reasonably expect an \[active participant of the network\] to further develop’ its functionality. This, according to the SEC, is indicative of a ‘reliance on the efforts of others.’   
&gt;  
&gt;The guidance also explains that if a token gives ‘the holder rights to share in the enterprise's income or profits or to realize a gain from capital appreciation,’ among other factors, ‘the more likely it is that there is a reasonable expectation of profit.’

&amp;#x200B;

Full chat here: [https://imgur.com/a/jU9bI5g](https://imgur.com/a/jU9bI5g)

Transaction here: [https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/e49f7b2b5b69648a851eb6575595e749371f6bc40d1098593c0dafd4937e3b3a](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/e49f7b2b5b69648a851eb6575595e749371f6bc40d1098593c0dafd4937e3b3a)

&amp;#x200B;

Step 1 - Check user's profile and accept the chat.

**0 day old account with no karma = scammer**

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2 - Pretend to be rich and dumb 

Him: ""I'm a certified Bitcoin analyst and Crypto Miner with a few years of Mining experience. What about you?""

Me: ""Just a noob who got lucky from buying some BTC years ago for fun""

Him: ""Am guessing you know a lot about bitcoin""

Me: ""Not really. Just that what I got is worth waaaay more than I got it for!""

**This kicks in the greed that blinds him**

&amp;#x200B;

Step 3 - Pretend to be interested

Him: ""...I got some good business ideas to share with you if you don't mind""

Me: ""Pitch it to me""

Him: ""Have you ever thought of earning $15,000 within five days with just a minimum start capital of $2,500 with bitcoin mining investment""

Me: ""That sounds awesome""

**Now he's excited that I'm falling for it**

&amp;#x200B;

Step 4 - Give only vague personal details

Him: ""But where are you from?""

Me: ""I'm from Ohio, I'd rather not say more""

**Just in case there's any social engineering at play.**

&amp;#x200B;

Step 5 - Keep the chat in reddit

Him: ""This is a Money-Business I can't talk on Reddit account that's 100% Hackable from afar/distance, I'd advise we move on to a different platform that is 100% secured...""

Me: ""I'd rather stay here""

Him: ""...but if we text on WhatsApp we can still get a chance to FaceTime... We'll also have a fast conversation on WhatsApp""

Me: ""Yes I understand but I will stay here""

**Keep the conversation at my pace on my terms without giving more personal information away**

&amp;#x200B;

Step 6 - Let him jabber on about his super legit money business and stay interested

&amp;#x200B;

Step 7 - Turn the conversation towards trust

Him: ""In order of Commencing your trading, I would like to know how ready and Serious you're about Investing and earning good Profits with bitcoin mining.""

Me: ""I'd want to know you're serious as well, and that I can trust you""

**The seed has been planted**

&amp;#x200B;

Step 8 - Reiterate that I'm rich and keep him greedy

Him: ""So in essence, you'll need to buy or own bitcoin in other to generate more and you'll need to have a blockchain wallet downloaded in other to do so.""

Me: ""I've got a Metamask wallet with 6.9 Bitcoin so I think we're covered there""

**Can't resist 69 references**

&amp;#x200B;

Step 9 - Recognize the scam

Him: ""You can only mine bitcoin with blockchain wallet and not any other wallet. Once it's programmed to the Antminer Device, your blockchain wallet can now mine bitcoin that are in it... If you'd like to mine bitcoin or find this interesting, you only need to worry about getting bitcoin and a blockchain wallet, that's all.""

Me: ""You said I didn't need to send any Bitcoin anywhere, but that's not true. I will need to send Bitcoin to the new wallet.""

**This puts tension on the seed of trust**

&amp;#x200B;

Step 10 - Reiterate the need for trust

Me: ""How can you show me that I can trust you to send that Bitcoin to the new wallet?""

Him: ""You can trust me and am way too old for games""

**Watering that seed of trust**

&amp;#x200B;

Step 11 - Bring it all together with incentive and an ultimatum

Me: ""Someone else is messaging me about a very similar investment where I can simply connect my existing Metamask wallet without sending Bitcoin anywhere. I would rather choose you. So I think the way I can know that I can trust you is for you to send me a tiny amount of Bitcoin first. Then I will send my large amount of 6.9. Can you send 0.0000069 Bitcoin to my address? If not, I will choose the other investment since it's easier to trust.""

**Now he thinks he'll lose out on 6.9 BTC**

&amp;#x200B;

Step 12 - Stand your ground

Him: ""I won't try to convince you to do this or trust me, trust is earned and I know very well that you're gonna thank me much later for my good Mining strategies.""

Me: ""You are correct to say that trust is earned. So earn it from me.""

Him: ""Earn it by how""

Me: ""You send me 0.0000069 BTC and I will invest 6.9 BTC. I'm the one taking on risk here, not you... Otherwise I will choose the other investment where I simply connect my existing wallet. They are very excited for me to join them, but you talked to me first""

**The pressure is high, the need for trust has blossomed, and the hook is set**

&amp;#x200B;

Step 13 - Enjoy the sweet spoils of victory

Him: ""Let me have your wallet address""

*I give it to him and he takes the bait! Then I say this after the transaction is verified:*

Me: ""When you realize what just happened, you'll experience the same feeling everyone else has had that's fallen for your scam. I just wish it were in proportion to the amount they lost.""

2759,CryptoCurrency,Captainwelfare2,"Yeah, I know, unpleasant subject, but life (and death) come at you fast.  Even if your wife or husband or partner or kids know about your crypto, are you confidant that if something happened to you, that they’d be able to access it.  I found myself asking that question this morning and the answer is a resounding no.  My wife understands the basics and could probably access my Coinbase, but beyond that, she wouldn’t know how to access my wallets, to send and recieve, access my ledger, etc. 

**As soon as I post this I’m getting off my phone and going to write down detailed instructions and explain everything she needs to know to her**

Some of you long time r/cc peeps know I’m a widower.  (This is my second account.). One day I was driving so my late wife and I could sell her goods at a convention.  3 days later I woke up in a hospital to find out she had died in the same car accident.  (I was riding passenger and asleep.). Anyway, take it from someone who has been there; that is the most surreal and overwhelming feeling anyone will have to go through.  When I got home there was a funeral to plan, a celebration of life, many bills and letters and the like to go through, insurance to file, accounts to cancel, death certificates to send, social security to contact, police reports to review, childcare to plan, etc etc etc, all while dealing with intense emotional pain and grief and helping my two children through their own struggles.  (They were extremely young; in that I was “lucky” )

My wife was an incredible woman and if she had foreseen all that her passing would have entailed, she would have planned detailed instructions for me.   6 years later I realized I have grown complacent and not done as much as I could should my wife have to deal with the same awful circumstances, and she would have 3 more children than i did on top of it.

If you notice any new unexpected token or NFT in your wallet that has been sent to you without your knowledge, just dont interact with them. Dont even hide them on OpenSea. Doing so executes a malicious code and the scammer can steal the rest of your wallet balances and NFTs. 

In particular, NFTs are being targeted here. The scammer sends a potential victim NFTs that are arbitrarily valued at say $100 in crypto.. so someone may think they can sell that on OpenSea and profit. The moment they go to list it and sign the transaction, they expose all other NFTs in the wallet to the scammer who then sweeps your wallet clean.

Pure comedy I swear. I was chatting with him a bit, so he found out that I knew he was a scammer and he didn't send me anything anymore. Basically he went to that classic trick where I need to send my VET coins to him so he can stake them  for a better profit. I have about a dozen such messages. 

On another occasion, I corresponded with the scammer for 3 days and he persistently kept explaining to me that his wallet was better for some reason and that I should do it in his wallet. Wow, madness.

However, I have also encountered smarter ones, such as where scammer “accidentally leaks” his private key to his Ethereum wallet on different platforms (reddit, viber, whatsapp, telegram groups, discord groups etc.). It can also be said that it is cosmic justice because people who try to abuse it come across some ERC20 shitcoins inside that wallet and send some ETH for fees to send those coins to their wallet but the scammer made a script with which he withdraws that ETH faster than someone trying to send those shitcoins. Thankfully I always avoid such stuff.

You can invest in a sound project that you believe has a strong future and hold for what may take a few years (which is not easy), or you can try to guess which low market cap coin will blow up soon for whatever reason (via FOMO, news, industry change, etc.). I’d argue the latter is more difficult and risky. There are over 6,800 projects listed on CoinMarketCap with more coming out every week. Someone who’s better at math than me can calculate the odds of guessing the next one of these that will 100X or 200X (or whatever X you want). 

Two times in my life I’ve invested a tiny bit of money and forgot about the investments. Both times they grew 3,000%+ over the next few years. Did I get extremely lucky? Of course. But which would have likely resulted in me making those gains regardless if we knew of the outcome? Me investing $20 into a random cheap coin and leaving it for years with a bullish limit sell order set, or me trying to day trade with thousands of dollars (which I didn’t have in the first place) without eventually losing whatever gains I may have managed to make? Of course there are tons of factors that shape your investment strategy, like the amount of money you have for investing, your goal, your current and future needs, etc. etc. However, I think time and time again we are proven more often than not that investing in sound projects and holding for years is the better way to make huge gains. If you have time (and the mentality) to play the long-term game that is. 

So why aren’t you making huge gains right now? Either you aren’t skilled at short term trading or you haven’t held long enough. Or, you know, your project is garbage lol.",Why You’re Not Making Huge Gains Right Now,1632754609

This needs to be offset, but only by those that are savvy enough to do so.

My personal strategy is to buy high and sell low so it only makes sense that it is time to book my losses.

This strategy may be difficult to most, but I can assure you it is way easier than it sounds.

Don’t forget, this allows you to FOMO back in at the top of the next green dildo.

My step dad has been married to my mom since I was like 2 and is like family to me. He is sort of a stereotypical boomer who never ventures far from what the mainstream believes, has very regular views, takes very sensible and responsible decisions, etc. He is a professor of economics at a business school, though. But he is the last person I'd expect to do anything even slightly controversial or different. When I have discussed non-mainstream topics with him in the past, he has always shut down my arguments completely.  


So my mom asks me how much I have invested in crypto, and I tell her. She does not complain too much, since it is only like 15% of my net worth, but does mention the regular sceptical remarks like ""it has already gone up so much, do you really think it can go up more"" and"" ""isn't it bad for the environment"", etc.  


My step dad then comes out of the blue and takes me completely by surprise. He tells my mom ""no, it can grow so much more because of scarcity"". He then pulls up his phone and shows me that he invested in Ethereum years ago and is now up 10x, and not selling. lol. Bullish.

**Stop whining, it’s just KYC/AML**

The supposed benefit of KYC/AML is preventing money laundering and financing of terrorism — commonly shortened to anti-money laundering (AML). The reason I say “supposed” is because the worldwide AML programs do little to curb any money laundering. According to a [recent study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25741292.2020.1725366), AML worldwide has about a 0.1% success rate, while costing institutions a great deal of resources in compliance costs.

But compliance isn’t the major KYC/AML cost — it’s the risk and lost opportunities that these requirements impose on ordinary people:

- Data leak risks: [everything leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches), it’s simply inevitable;
- Data sharing risks: you may think you provide data to an exchange, but these data are going to be shared with third parties and government agencies;
- Personal risks: leaked or stolen data can be used against you in an attempt to steal your coins, both remotely (phishing) and physically (home invasion);
- Confiscation risks: laws change all the time and there might come a time when a [6102 type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102) of legislature is passed;
- Lost opportunities: people from sanctioned countries or without required documentation are ostracized from using bitcoin-related services in the same fashion as from the legacy finance industry.

On top of these risks, consider the public nature of the Bitcoin blockchain. When you buy bitcoin on an exchange that has your full identity, this exchange can track your withdrawal and subsequent transactions. In fact, exchanges regularly cooperate with chain analysis companies that make it their business to track users’ transaction behavior.

* Case 2 happened China didn't move a finger for Evergrande and Chinese investors runs into crypto.
* China bank watch the liquidity exit from deposits and the jump into more exotic investments so they use the harmer to ban crypto scared of a massive run out when Evergrande enters in technical bankruptcy in the next months.

* Fed announced they will start tapering again, so no more ""el cheapo"" liquidity running into the market, Why they do this? Because inflation previsions(the ones which aren't public of course) are all time high and we are in risk of massive inflation period.

## Bitcoin

Bitcoin, BTC to USD, fell by 8.58% in the week ending 26th September. Reversing a 2.61% gain from the week prior, Bitcoin ended the week at $43,190.0.

A mixed start to the week saw Bitcoin rise to a Monday intraweek high $47,327.0 before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $49,557, Bitcoin slid to a Tuesday intraweek low $39,678.0.

The sell-off saw Bitcoin fall through the first major support level at $44,182 and the second major support level at $41,126.

Bitcoin also fell through the 38.2% FIB of $41,592 before revisiting $45,000 levels.

In the 2nd half of the week, Bitcoin fell back through the first and second major support levels and the 38.2% FIB to sub-$41,000 levels before finding support.

Bitcoin broke back through the second major support level and the 38.2% FIB to end the week at $43,000 levels.

4 days in the red that included an 8.92% slide on Monday and a 5.92% fall on Tuesday delivered the downside for the week.

### For the week ahead

Bitcoin would need to avoid a fall back through the $43,398 pivot to support a run the first major resistance level at $47,119.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break back through to $47,000 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and last week’s high $47,327.0 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of an extended breakout, Bitcoin could test resistance at the 23.6% FIB of $50,473 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $51,047.

A fall back through the $43,398 pivot would bring the 38.2% FIB of $41,592 and the first major support level at $39,470 into play.

Barring an extended sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of the second major support level at $35,749.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 2.51% to $44,273.0. A mixed start to the week saw Bitcoin fall to an early Monday low $42,971.0 before rising to an early Monday high $44,333.0.

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

## Ethereum

Ethereum fell by 8.05% in the week ending 27th September. Following a 2.21% decline from the previous week, Ethereum ended the week at $3,060.71.

A mixed start to the week saw Ethereum rise to a Monday intraweek high $3,346.58 before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the 23.6% FIB of $3,369 and the first major resistance level at $3,633, Ethereum slid to a Tuesday intraweek low $2,651.0.

The reversal saw Ethereum fall through the first major support level at $3,068 and the second major support level at $2,807.

Ethereum also fell through the 38.2% FIB of $2,740 before revisiting $3,100 levels.

A 2nd pullback late in the week saw Ethereum fall back through the first and second major support levels.

Finding support at the 38.2% FIB of $2,740, however, Ethereum broke back through the second major support level to end the week at $3,060 levels.

The first major support level at $3,068 pegged Ethereum back at the end of the week.

4-days in the red that included a 10.58% slide on Monday delivered the downside in the week.

### For the week ahead

Ethereum would need avoid the $3,019 pivot level to support a run at the 23.6% FIB of $3,369 and the first major resistance level at $3,388.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break out from $3,300 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at $3,400 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of another extended breakout, Ethereum could test resistance at $4,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $3,715.

A fall through the $3,019 pivot would bring the 38.2% FIB of $2,740 and the first major support level at $2,692 into play.

Barring an extended sell-off in the week, Ethereum should steer clear of sub-$2,500 support levels. The second major support level sits at $2,324.

At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 3.18% to $3,158.12. A choppy start to the week saw Ethereum fall to an early Monday low $3,028.76 before rising to a high $3,166.79.

Ethereum left the major support and resistance levels untested at the start of the week.

# What is it?

Cosmos (ATOM) was created in 2016, when the programmer Jae Kwon created the white paper of the project called ***“Gnuclear”***.  The latter provided for the use of a completely decentralized interoperable blockchain system, possible through the use of the so-called Tendermint ""consensus protocol"", useful for the purpose.  The idea was later perfected with the help of community programmers, thanks to whom, after numerous changes, on 5 August of the same year, the project was renamed Cosmos.

# How does it work?

The purpose of Cosmos is based on a structure known as ***The Hub***. The Cosmos Hub, is actually a ledger that keeps the main story of the entire Cosmos network. In simpler words, it is a blockchain that stores the information of everything that happens in Cosmos and the actions that are performed between the different actors that are interconnected to its network.  For example, if two blockchains interconnected with Cosmos share certain events, those events will be recorded in the central Hub of Cosmos to witness what happened. At the same time, the results of those actions will be recorded in the respective blockchain they interacted with. In this way, the evidence of the interaction is recorded in such a way that there is no way to deny it. This is very useful, as this type of structure makes it very easy to develop DApps (decentralized applications). In any case, the Hub is a story of events between the participants in the Cosmos network. This story is possible thanks to the existence of the Cosmos blockchain communication protocol (***IBC for Inter Blockchain Communication***). The task of this protocol is to provide a standard connector that allows blockchains within Cosmos to exchange messages and share information, while maintaining a complete log of such messages within the Hub.  In this way it is possible to enable exchanges in a completely decentralized way between all blockchains. The purpose of this idea is so broad that Cosmos is known in the cryptocurrency world as ""the Internet of the Blockchain""

2878,CryptoCurrency,Many_Arm7466,"Does anybody else hate the articles or posts about “If you had bought Bitcoin in 2010 instead of groceries it would be worth this much at today’s price”... I feel like this type of thinking is counterproductive and just serves to rub it in our faces that we missed out on life changing wealth. 

The thing is if you looked at Bitcoin then it was a highly speculative concept with a lot of unfamiliarity and shadiness associated with it. Of course now in hindsight it’s obvious that we should have bought in. But just like anything it was a risky bet in which nobody not even Satoshi himself could have predicted what it would be today. 

So stop slapping yourself over not buying in earlier or if you did selling too early, cause there is no way you could have known it would be as big as it is today.

If your aunt had balls she would be your uncle... but she doesn’t and she isn’t. Just like if you had bought into Bitcoin in 2010 you would be rich... but you didn’t and you’re not. And that is perfectly okay because guess what my little crayon eating Redditor... you’re still early. We see amazing projects coming up and Crypto and Bitcoin are not even remotely near their potential peaks

For this week the community has voted for TEZOS

Now lets deep dive into this project: 

# TEZOS - THE BASICS

What is Tezos? Well to keep it short and crispy. Tezos is an open source platform that can upgrade itself, meaning that the nodes are proposing and suggesting what will be upgraded to the core protocol. 

As you guessed, this is a very decentralized concept and it is very different than other platforms such Ethereum and especially Bitcoin. This allows Tezos to evolve without a danger of a hard work. 

You are wondering who can do that? 

Users that hold the XTZ token are able to propose updates for the protocol and this is then moved forward to the developers who are working on that and keeping the community updated about the timeliness and important updates. 

To make it clear, and to pin point some main facts, the main features of Tezos are as following:

* **Self Amendment:** This is allowing Tezos to do updates on a regular basis, and the best thing about it is that it doesn't need to split the network to do so (fork), the other big benefit is the cost effectiveness as this is saving funds and time and holders can easily vote and suggest on different proposals. 
* **On Chain Governance:** Users can participate in the decision making process, and therefore have an direct impact on the upcoming focus in terms of development. 
* **Decentralized Innovation:** If you came up with a cool idea and upgrade that helped the network you can get some awards and fundings as a thank you for improving the network. 
* **Smart-Contracts:** The platform allows you to create applications that are decentralized without the chance of interfierence from third parties that could potentially close them down. 
* **Proof of Stake (PoS):** All the nodes or participants of the Tezos network provide the needed computing power to keep the network running. Proof of Stake allows nodes (participants) to reach consensus on the network and unlike some other PoS cases, it is also giving certain rewards to nodes that managed to improve the platform. 
* **PoS delegation:** You need to make a deposit in order to participate, in case that certain users disbehave or act illegal, they are losing their deposit. This makes the network secure and secure for different attempts of scamming. 

# FOUNDERS

**Tezos was founded by Arthur Breitman in August 2014 together with his wife the a co-founder Kathleen Breitman.** 

Arthur Breitman is a former quantitative analyst and worked for companies such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. 

Kathleen Breitman worked as an senior strategist for companies such as R3 and Accenture. 

**In August and September of 2014, Arthur released the first papers related to the concept and idea of the Tezos platform - The Position Paper and the White Paper**. This was written using a pseudonym ""LM Goodman"" as a kudos to the Newsweek author who claimed that tracked and found the real Satoshi Nakamoto. 

In 2015 Arthur Breitman has founded a company called: Dynamic Ledger Solutions or just simply DLS. This newly formed company had the total control of the intellectual properties for Tezos, together with all the codes. 

**But the big event and breakthrough on the mainstream stage happened in 2017 as Tezos became the most succesfull ICO in its history, raising a total of 232 million $**. This brought some serious attention to them and the world watched it closely, especially after the price jumped to an 8.98$ level before crashing into a below 5$ price tag. 

Even though Tezos had a great start, things went a bit south from that point. Legal actions, threats, articles and scandals surrounded Arthur and Kathleen at that time. 

Before the Tezos ICO, Arthur and Kathleen had partnered up with the entrepreneur Johann Gevers and soon trusted him a position as the president of the Tezos Foundation. Gevers had a shady backround and not much information could be found, but he was a special character with a unique presence. 

After the ICO, Gevers claimed that he had an agreement with Arthur and Kathleen where it was stated that they would sell DLS, which had all the intellectual rights for the platform, to the Tezos Foundation which Gevers controlled as the president. He claimed that the agreement stated that if the DLS is not sold to the Tezos Foundation in a reasonable time it will gain the right to acquire DLS for free. There was only one little problem for Gevers at that time, he had no agreement to show to the public that backed this claim up. 

Soon after that The Bretimans started a legal battle against Gevers which ended in 2018, when Gevers and a couple of other board members of the foundation stepped down - giving the control of the foundation back to Arthur and Kathleen. 

After 2018 and up to last year, there was very little attention around Tezos in general, and that allowed them to focus entirely on the development of the platform. 

# TEZOS PLATFORM

As mentioned in the basics, Tezos is decentralized and a peer to peer network allowing its participants (nodes) to vote for updates and give proposals, which is a an advanced approach comparing it to Bitcoins PoW and comparing it to Ethereum as Tezos uses delegate Proof of Stake, as mentioned above. 

But how does this work behind the scenes? 

There are three main protocols: **The Network Protocol, The Transaction Protocol and The Consensus Protocol** 

**The Network Protocol** determines the blocks and broadcasts them through the chain as it basically  is linking everything needed to the nodes and gives them all what they require to maintain the integrity of the network. 

**The Transaction Protocol** is governing and making sure to have all the information about the transactions on the chain 

While **the Consensus Protocol** utilizes the Delegate Proof of Stake system in place, making sure that everything is decentralized and in consensus regarding upgrades and voting in general. 

The Network shell is linking all these protocols together making it a unique Blockchain protocol. The coding language that is used is OCaml as its capable to indentify all three main elements: protocols, blocks and transactions. 

# TOKENIZATION

During the ICO, Tezos offered 80% for Public Sale, while 20% were allocated equally to DLS and the Tezos Foundation. 

In terms of the supply, here are the basics: 

**Circulating Supply:** 860,988,147.79 XTZ

**Total Supply:** 890,296,002 XTZ

# ROADMAP

In terms of the Roadmap, Tezos, as mentioned is accepting suggestions for future upgrades, and therefore is shifting its focus one-by-one as this proved to be the most cost effective and technology effective approach comparing to other projects. 

The newest proposal that was accepted and the update that is upcoming is the so called Hangzhou update, which is planning to do some major and minor improvements to the network such as Timelock encryption, Views as entrypoints for smart contracts, Cache - in order to get faster access to data, Global Table of Constants - allowing to create larger and more complex contracts and Context Flattening in order to optimise storage use. 

# PARTNERSHIPS

In terms of Partnerships, Tezos is doing a great job this year. One of the main concerns in the last couple of years was the marketing outreach towards the wider crypto community, and with partnersips with Formula 1 giant such as Red Bull Racing and Baseball giant NY Mets, Tezos managed to grow its popularity among crypto investors, which has also reflected in the recent price movement.

Beside the partnership with sporting teams, I have to add that Tezos also managed to partner up with some other big time giants:

**McLaren Racing:** Building their official NFT platform

**Ubisoft:** Joined Tezos protocol as a corporate baker

**OneOf:** Raises $63M in Seed Funding to Build Music NFT Platform on Tezos

**Societe Generale:** Selected Tezos blockchain for Central bank currency

**Groupe Casino:** This French ‘mass-market’ retail group with over 220,000 employees worldwide and 11,000 stores, announced the creation of a Euro Stablecoin (Lugh), built on the Tezos blockchain 

# NFT MARKETPLACE

NFT is gaining some serious traction in the cryptoworld, and Tezos became one of the most important blockchains that is hosting some of the biggest NFT Marketplaces. This also resulted in an increase of smart contracts that is rising each month and this is especially due the fact of the popular marketplaces such as **Hic et Nunc** then we have **Kalamint** and **Bazaar**. We have to mention also that in the gaming world there is the popular **Tezotopia** that is gaining some traction as well. Adding to this the official news that **Marvel** is choosing Tezos and also the already mentioned news about **McLaren** and **OneOf** which concludes that Tezos is one of the biggest NFT drivers at the moment.

# CONCLUSION

I am going to be honest. Tezos is seriously undervalued. I could write twenty more pages about some super interesting facts about Tezos, such as active nodes, TPS, growing ecosystem that is counting more than 100 of them and other ongoing partnerships and projects in the NFT space.

It amazes me that this project is still not a a TOP 10 by marketcap, but seeing it growing with the attention of the community here day in day out, I am sure that this will happen very soon, I would even say that this could happen during the next bullrun where it could seriously disrupt the current order of the TOP 10 coins.

The only concern was the rough beginning that Tezos had in 2017, but since then, it was just an amazing progress with an technology that is on paper far advanced of its main competitors such as Ethereum, Polkadot, Cardano and Cosmos. The other concern ""was"" marketing, but there was some great movement in that field as well, seems like that Tezos stepped up and started to invest into a experienced marketing team that is trying to push the project out there.

I am going to follow Tezos closely, and I am sure that a lot of investors that did a extensive DYOR will do this too. This project is very promising, and I am certain that we will read more great things about this amazing project.

 Bitcoin, BTC to USD, fell by 0.34% on Saturday. Following a 4.54% slide on Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $42,714.0. 

A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning intraday high $42,986.9 before hitting reverse.

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $45,095, Bitcoin slid to a late morning intraday low $41,728.0.

Steering clear of the 38.2% FIB of $41,592 and the first major support level at $40,686, Bitcoin revisited $42,900 levels before easing back into the red.

The near-term bullish trend remained intact, in spite of the latest return to sub-$40,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need a sustained fall through the 62% FIB of $27,237 to form a near-term bearish trend.

## The Rest of the Pack

Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Saturday.

Chainlink led the way, rallying by 5.43%, with Bitcoin Cash SV (0.64%), Cardano’s ADA (+1.00%), and Crypto.com Coin (+2.01%) also finding support on the day.

It was a bearish day for the rest of the majors, however.

Polkadot fell by 2.84% to lead the way down.

Binance Coin (-1.52%), Ethereum (-0.22%), Litecoin (-0.83%), and Ripple’s XRP (-0.53%) also joined Bitcoin in the red.

In the current week, the crypto total market rose to a Monday high $2,136bn before sliding to a Tuesday low $1,744bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $1,910bn.

Bitcoin’s dominance rose to a Monday high 42.97% before falling to a Friday low 40.99%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 41.91%.

## This Morning

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.36% to $42,559.0. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning high $42,767.0 before falling to a low $42,451.0.

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

Elsewhere, it was a bearish start to the day.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash SV was down by 2.47% to lead the way down.

## For the Bitcoin Day Ahead

Bitcoin would need to avoid a fall back through the $42,476 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $43,225 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from Saturday’s high $42,986.8.

Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely cap the upside.

In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $45,000 levels before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $43,735.

A fall back through the $42,476 pivot would bring the first major support level at $41,966 and the 38.2% FIB of $41,592 into play.

Barring another extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$40,000. The second major support level at $41,218 should limit the downside.","Cryptocurrency Movers and Shakers – September 26th, 2021",1632667741

In today’s Web 2.0 paradigm, China uses its population's data to keep the country in order. Digital monopolies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon are building unassailable AI capabilities to monetise free users' data. Just imagine that Google alone makes $130Bn per year from selling our data - a figure that accounts for over 80% of their revenue. Ultimately, everybody in today's world is fighting for who ‘owns’ our data to increase their supremacy. 

But, cryptocurrencies (and blockchain in general) could jeopardise this economic stability. In fact, the raise of blockchain technology is giving us the tools to write tomorrow's Web 3.0 paradigm and ensure no single entity controls our data. Crypto startups such as Fractal Protocol are building decentralised data marketplaces to enable users to take back control of their data. This way they are reducing, and eventually removing, the competitive advantage of hoarding private data by enabling anybody to monetise the data we share and generate.

Through companies such as Fractal, we will be able to choose IF China, Google or Facebook can use our data, or we could decide to auction it off to get the best price. We might decide to only sell general information, but not our genomic data. Perhaps we could rent access to genomic data to cancer research charities but not insurers. 

We aren’t there yet, but the fight is happening and the need for a decentralised data commons is real. Over 500,000 users are already using Fractal's decentralised data commons and large monopolies such as Google are already working on more private ecosystems such as Google Privacy Sandbox.

Unfortunately today getting paid for said project was near impossible thanks to PayPal.

The client wanted to pay via PayPal (quick and easy) - I accepted until PayPal decided to limit my account. An account that had already received previous payments without a hitch.

They wanted additional documents such as proof of invoice from supplier, proof of ID, proof of receipt from the client and so much more. After submitting requested information it was rejected not once but 3 times. Speaking to customer support was like speaking to a brick wall. Even after providing my UK Passport. The client even marked the transaction as received on their side. No Luck!

Paypal are refusing to allow me to withdraw £100 to my bank account. They have held the money for almost 7 days. I decided to give up and refund the client.

Luckily for me. The client was able to pay in BTC. The client did and guess what. No judgement. I got paid for the job.

The country is facing an electricity crunch that intensifies in winter and the government might have to impose restrictions on Bitcoin mining to ensure ample electricity to the people.



Kazakhstan’s share of Bitcoin mining rose six folds in April this year as new anti-crypto policies of China forced the significant sections of large Bitcoin miners to relocate to compliant nations with abundant clean energy supply. The central American nation ranked third in terms of Bitcoin mining share after the USA and China. China had the biggest Bitcoin mining share with over 75% market dominance, but that fell sharply post April and many believe a majority of the miners have already relocated to other nations.

The Bitcoin network’s hash power nosedived by half post the Chinese exodus, and it has returned to pre-Chinese crackdown levels now, suggesting the majority of miners have already begun their mining operations again.

Kazakhstan Might Follow Iran’s Lead by Temporarily Restricting BTC Mining

The electricity crisis in states with legal Bitcoin mining operations has become a norm as Iran faced a similar crisis in the first quarter of 2021. The Iranian government has legalized BTC mining in the country as a way to help its declining economy and fight against trade sanctions. But, the government soon realized that illegal miners were exploiting limited energy resources leading to several blackouts in the state. As a result, the government announced a temporary ban on Bitcoin mining until September 22 to ensure there is ample electricity throughout the harsh summer.

Similarly, Kazakhstan might have to impose some sort of temporary BTC mining ban in the state to ensure continuous electricity supply during the harsh winters.

While the crypto space is currently eagerly awaiting Cardano's smart contract launch, another Ethereum competitor, Tezos (XTZ), has landed a prestigious partnership. Swiss companies Crypto Finance, InCore Bank, and Inacta will rely on Tezos for asset tokenization in the future.

To this end, the IT company has developed ""DAR-1,"" a new token standard. DAR-1 is in turn based on the FA2 standard from Tezos. FA2 enables both single- and multi-token smart contracts via a standardized programming interface. The token standard allows multiple transfers of different tokens (types) in a single transaction.

Tezos was chosen to push the new standard for asset tokenization because its on-chain governance enables upgrades without disrupting or splitting the network. 

In the same media release, InCore Bank announced the launch of XTZ Staking services for its institutional clients. InCore is the first Swiss B2B bank to make this possible, he said. XTZ Staking is to be provided directly through InCore Bank's e-banking portal, with Crypto Finance providing crypto custody. 

At the time of going to press, the Tezos share price is trading at USD 4.11, with a delicate daily gain of 2.5 percent. There is still more than 100 percent to go before the all-time high: On May 7, XTZ had set its previous price record at USD 8.27.

This is because the crypto exchange has entered into a partnership with the German e-sports organization Berlin International Gaming (BIG). The latter sets up teams for various computer games (CS:GO for example) and participates in eSports tournaments with them. 

A look at the prize money of past eSports tournaments shows that such tournaments are also financially rewarding.

Meanwhile, Coinbase is launching branches in more and more countries at an impressive pace. Like Coinbase Germany, which received its license to trade cryptocurrencies in June 2021. Or Coinbase Japan, which recently went live in August.

*""Today we can welcome Coinbase, one of the world's leading crypto platforms, as a partner. The world of cryptocurrencies is an enormously exciting environment, and it is my ambition through our partnership to make more people aware of this fast-growing ecosystem, with all its opportunities and risks.""*

I am looking for a cryptocurrency which would enable me to receive payments of as low as 2.5 euros, or preferably even lower than 1. 

As far as I am informed, many providers have a minimum which can go much higher than the whole amount of the payments I need. Also, gas fees sometimes make it impossible for micropayments.

I would appreciate it if you introduced some currencies, gateways or payment providers enabling me to receive micropayments.

According to a survey, approximately every third swing state resident would like to see local authorities legalizing cryptocurrencies as a payment option. While general support towards private digital currencies is on a high level, the locals still need to learn more, the research revealed.

Most of the states in the USA have been historically consistent in their votes and have never changed their either democratic or republican stance in the period between 2000 and 2016. However, there are 13 of them, known as swing or battleground states, that usually decide the results of each political campaign.

The cryptocurrency development in recent years could be another factor that politicians should keep in mind, as Louisa Idel, head of insights at Redfield &amp; Wilton, pointed out:

**“If a party wants to catch these receptive voters, it should act swiftly – not only to beat the other party to the punch but also to preempt legislation that would prove difficult to reverse if enacted.”**

At the end of July, the suspension of futures and derivatives trading on the world's largest crypto exchange Binance caused a stir. At that time, users from Germany, Italy and the Netherlands were asked to close open positions. Users were to be given 90 days to do so. The start of the period would be ""communicated at a later date"".

The message states: Binance email from September 24

*""Please review all open positions and close them before 23 December 2021, 23:59 UTC. After that, you will not be able to close the positions manually and Binance will close all remaining open positions.""*

So far, there has been no public statement on the part of Binance regarding the mail. Neither on the platform's blog nor on the social media channels. Likewise, not all users received the corresponding message. Until the crypto exchange makes an official statement, the information should be treated with caution for the time being.

Sad to see. Binance is by far my favorite exchange because it was so easy to just stake and see your portfolio grow. Sadly not a single other exchange was so nice.

3117,CryptoCurrency,SuperSan93,"The Bitcoin energy argument is created through cherry picked statistics and propagated by those who have no understanding of the network.

The main argument people make is that Bitcoin uses X amount of energy for every transaction. Usually a widely high figure.

Bitcoin operates on two layers. The blockchain and a second layer that includes trades on exchanges, the lightning network and retail payment systems.

The vast majority of transactions happen on that second layer because they are instantaneous, cost nothing or almost nothing and don’t need to interact with the blockchain allowing users to make an almost unlimited number of transactions until the payment facilitators settle the transactions on the blockchain called a final settlement.

When misinformation propagators say Bitcoin costs X energy per transaction they are ignoring the fact that a single transaction on the blockchain could include a nearly unlimited number transactions from the second layer.

Energy consumption on the blockchain is because Bitcoin runs on a proof-of-work system that uses computers to find hashes, a chain of numbers and letters. This is called mining. The more computer power dedicated to mining, the more difficult the hash is. On average regardless of the number of miners it take 10 minutes to begin a new block on the blockchain. This makes it impossible for a group, organization or country to tamper with the blockchain because they’d have to provide more energy than all the other miners combined before they could do anything malicious.

Therefore we can see that “Bitcoin uses X energy to make a transaction” is false because any number of transaction could be made per block via the second layer.

The energy it does use is for security and if you’re going to use Bitcoin as the worlds new monetary system you better have some fully tamper proof security in place.

Finally, when you compare bitcoins energy usage to the current world monetary systems you’ll find that Bitcoin’s power requirements needed to secure the network is a mere fraction of the amount required by banks and financial institutions and results of government issued money making Bitcoin very environmentally friendly, comparatively speaking.

# What is it?

Hedera Hashgraph is a distributed public ledger and its native token is called HBAR.  Hashgraph doesn't use a blockchain like most other cryptocurrencies. Instead, it uses a ""gossip protocol"" designed to facilitate high-speed transactions and fast finality. Hashgraph is the name of the technology itself. Putting it all down to simpler terms, a hashgraph is a way that computers communicate with each other, which has nothing to do with the blockchain. Hashgraph was invented by a Swiss technology company called Swirlds, which then decided to create an entirely public version of this technology. In other words, they wanted to create a completely open hashgraph where anyone could enter and have their computers communicate with other computers, thus also allowing development for applications such as cryptocurrencies.  The native token of this public hashgraph network is called HBAR.  Hedera is the name of the non-profit board responsible for overseeing this public network. That's why this public network is called Hedera Hashgraph.  Hedera is made up of 40 government organizations representing a range of industries. Among the most recognizable members are Google, IBM, LG and Boeing. The council decides on issues such as basic code changes, treasury management, network security, mutability and legal compliance.  This practical business approach applied by Hedera Hashgraph is in contrast to distributed ledgers such as Ethereum and Cardano, which emphasize the importance of decentralization and community management.

# How does it work?

The hashgraph distributed ledger is known to be very fast and is expected to perform 10,000 transactions per second initially and hundreds of transactions per second later on.  Its secret is that it provides all the computers on its network with a much faster way to communicate with each other. Hedera calls it the ""gossip"" protocol.  Traditional blockchains work by packing transactions into blocks and then with miners who have to complete the processing of each block. Blocks only emerge periodically, so transactions basically need to increase block passing if they want to be sent.  Instead, Hashgraph packages transactions as ""events"" on the fly and then simply lets them pass through the network.  When you make a transaction on Hashgraph, your computer will pack it into an event and communicate that event to two other randomly chosen computers on the network. These two computers will communicate that transaction to two others, and so on.  In other words, they will ""gossip"" about events until the entire network is aware of what happened. At this point, you will have levels of trust and immutability similar to those of a blockchain.  This system is made faster by three additional factors:

* Hashgraph is optimized for fast HBAR transactions rather than high-speed smart contracts.
* The size of the data you need to communicate in each HBAR transaction is very small, which means that Hashgraph nodes can gossip to each other very quickly.
* Users can choose the level of confidence they want to have in the validity of each HBAR transaction, which allows people to further optimize individual transactions for faster speed or greater certainty based on their personal needs.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallets for HBAR are HEX, MyHbarWallet, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

When you make a good profit, FOMO is stronger than ever, the adrenaline rushes you, you finally made some money and you waited. You’ve gone through that FOMO but the price is still rising and FOMO is getting stronger and stronger. You don't know if you will regret it in the morning if you sell or if you will be happy that you sold on time. Greed grows unconsciously.

I see a lot of, almost certainly younger people, not understand what this would actually mean to them so I thought I would crunch the numbers for you all to get a really rough idea.

A few points first:

1) 8% is clearly not a bank savings account rate, he clearly means investments.

2) 8% is quite generous when the average over long periods of time is much higher and if you are DCAing into regularly would be EVEN HIGHER as you would be in a position to make far larger returns on dips in the market (anyone investing in the stock market during COVID make serious bank within 6 months). As such I used 10% as a rough average per annum in my calculations.

3) I choose a time period of 32 years so someone working from 18-50 which in the UK is an extremely early retirement atm with our state pension only starting at a ridiculous 68 so this retirement plan would be 18 years early.

4) A retirement plan would/should grant more than just a reflection of the stock market. Example, in the UK the government will match 20% of what you save. I'm sure you can find similar results from your own local area.

5) You don't have to take the entire retirement plan once you retire, in fact if you retire early generally the better idea is to take the \~10% growth per annum as a 'salary' to live on forever with the estate then being transferred to your children so they don't have to go through the same rat race as we all did.

6) You can invest in traditional stock markets AND crypto. I am invested in both and have no interest in  YOLOing into either, diversify investments and DCAing all the way.

7) Although the quote was implying traditional stock markets there is (almost) no reason why this same logic cannot also be used on crypto and as can be seen on the below values that \~10% per annum gains are more than enough and should be used to help fight the greed to invest in absolute SHITCOINS TM. You just don't need the high risk returns to make a decent retirement plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Worked example: £10 per week is £520 per annum saved, plus a retirement 20% from the government of £104, and an average growth of 10% (of the now £624) grants an additional £62.40 for a total yearly value of £686.40.

&amp;#x200B;

32 year results based on the above:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img k3uxozt2sgp71...*

As can be seen from the EXTREMELY ROUGH calculations:

£5 per week is not really enough for an early retirement on it's own.

£10 a week, the cost of a couple of Starbucks morning coffees over making your own, nets you a mid range house or an okay income but no expensive old person holidays.

£20 a week, or the cost of a large Dominos take away for two, now this is where it really starts to pay off. A large, modern house in the countryside or a decent living wage for the UK. For a married couple where both people carried out this plan that would be a household income of &gt;£50k per year which is very good for the UK.

And £50 a week, I've seen people spend more on a Friday night out but yes this is certainly a savings plan that the average person would have to make cuts for. Oh my, that yearly salary is more than a married couple of two Doctors (in non medical fields) will earn while working for zero effort, forever. If a couple of people both do this you are looking at holidays basically 24/7 AND the lump sum would set their children up for life.

3151,CryptoCurrency,GooeyButterflies,"Day trading gets a bad rap on this sub and it's justifiable. Your best option for long term wealth is ALWAYS going to be to buy and hold...But sometimes trading can be fun and entertaining. It's another way to interact with your crypto hobby and engage in the market.

As someone who has found success with shorter-term trading in the crypto market, I thought I would give some tips that I have found useful to those of you that are interested in trying it out (Please forgive my mobile formatting):

First of all, I don't know if the term ""day trading"" is the best. I think the best time frame to trade on is a couple trades a week or even week to week trading. It's the best option to capture the major moves in the market.

~

I think the most important factor in trading successfully is to completely remove your emotions from the market. Look that the math, the fundamentals, and make calculated decisions. Stick to the entry and exit positions that you set ahead of time. Trading is all about planning and acting according to plan no matter how you are feeling at the moment. 

~

Don't seek out trades where none exist, not every day presents an opportunity. Know the position that you're looking for and wait for it to present itself. 

~

Learn how the markets move. Each coin has a unique way of moving when it pumps and dumps. Find a few coins that you really like (preferably ones with a promising outlook) and stick to trading those. Don't fomo into whatever coin is hot that week.

~

Be aware of where the market is at currently. Is BTC in a bull market or bear market? Altcoins behave drastically different depending on if BTC is in above or below the 20 week. Pay attention to the BTC dominance and where we are at in the market cycle.

~

Don't fucking get your information from youtube or reddit. No one knows which coins are going to do what. Honestly, more often that not, when everyone is preaching something on the internet, the exact opposite thing happens. (You can even use that to your advantage 😉). The only exception that I can't recommend enough is Benjamin Cowen on youtube. The furthest thing from a trading channel, but he gives a realistic, data-based analysis on the market. It's great information to absorb and use to plan out your trading strategy.

~

Don't use leverage. Just fucking don't. Use your own money.

~

DON'T BE GREEDY. Greed is the number 1 thing that will lead you to go against everything listed above and is the reason why trading doesn't work out for most people. 

~

Some people like using TA, I don't. I think it's ultimately useless and a waste of time. Just worry about red days, green days, and larger market trends. It can be as simple as that.

~

Keep record of all your trades so that you can analyze your approach and calculate your taxes easily when that time rolls around.

~

Like everything, you get better with practice. Practice trading with a small amount that won't hurt if it goes to zero. Over time you will gain a better understanding of how the market works and become better at making trades that you are confident in.

~

I honestly think that short-term trading can be easier with crypto as opposed to other markets because crypto is so volatile. If you make a trade and pick a calculated, realistic exit point, there is a really good chance that the coin you are looking at will reach it at some point. It's all about being immune to the short term volatility and capitalizing on the longer term volatility.

The TezAsia Hackathon

TZ APAC, one of the leading Asia adoption entities supporting the Tezos ecosystem, today announced the winners of the largest Tezos blockchain hackathon – TezAsia. In partnership with Tezos India &amp; Chainstack, this month-long hackathon saw participants develop novel solutions across three tracks: DeFi, NFTs and Collectibles, and Tools and Wallets on the Tezos blockchain. 
The hackathon was a grand success and received over 1400 registrations, 1600 individual participants and teams, who submitted 36 projects across the 3 tracks.
The jury selected Tezco as the winner – a global carbon currency that can enable the purchase of carbon-emitting products via gamification, NFT, and P2P DeFi staking, to reduce the impact of climate change by integrating the Tezos network to provide universal and transparent transactions.
In second place was Radiate Finance, a streaming protocol in which users can create a stream to transfer tokens in real-time. Omni Swap – a credit default swaps solution on blockchain to remove overcollaterization requirements in loans facilities – came in third. The winners received grants of up to USD 10,000 each, allowing them to take their projects to the next level.

“Some of the projects born from the TezAsia hackathon were really outstanding in the quality of their presentation, MVP product readiness and execution from the participants. I’m impressed and confident in what will come in the future of the Tezos ecosystem.” said Sebastien Borget, President, Blockchain Game Alliance.

With an objective of fostering budding blockchain talent in the region and challenging participants to devise solutions for a greener future – the TezAsia Hackathon  brought together novices, advanced coders, students, working professionals, and blockchain enthusiasts from a wide spectrum of industries across the region.
The hackathon was held on the Devfolio platform and offered USD 14,000 in prizes across all tracks. 

“TezAsia brought forward eager participants who put transformative solutions and sustainability at the forefront of their projects. We are looking forward to conducting more programs in the future to foster the growing blockchain talent and make the region stronger than ever” said Om Malviya, President, Tezos India.

“The sheer number of ideas and high-quality proof-of-concepts shared by TezAsia’s participants demonstrates that we have barely scratched the surface of Asia’s creative potential, when it comes to harnessing blockchain technology to develop real-world solutions.
TZ APAC is committed to cultivating and bringing these ideas to market on the Tezos blockchain” said David Tng, Head of Growth, TZ APAC.

While some of the ideas presented will continue to be developed into robust, market-ready solutions, the TezAsia Hackathon also shone a spotlight on much of the developer talent in the region, which has attracted the interest of blockchain companies seeking to recruit these bright minds. 

“We are proud to have supported this event that has brought various ideas and projects into fruition. Dedicated to magnifying accessibility within Web3, Chainstack strives to continuously innovate and support the ever growing Tezos ecosystem.
The event was a huge success in nurturing the next batch of developers and builders that not only accelerate the growth of DeFi and Web3 as a whole, but also bring more sustainable solutions to all.” said Eugene Aseev, CTO &amp; Founder of Chainstack.

Beyond the TezAsia Hackathon, TZ APAC and Tezos India have also partnered with Microsoft, Skoda and Tech Mahindra to deliver the Microsoft Century Program – a corporate-SME bridge program that seeks to uncover blockchain-based solutions on Tezos, for industry-specific use cases.

It has been a long time since Bitcoin was valued at less than $1,000, so it’s almost hard to appreciate just how much has its value climbed up over the years. The story of Kristoffer Koch should be able to put things into perspective for you.

In 2009, Kristoffer was busy writing his master thesis on encryption technology at his University in Norway. While researching the latest applications of encryption, he came across the unknown virtual currency called Bitcoin. Determined to experience first-hand what Bitcoin was all about, he decided to spend around $26, which allowed him to purchase—hold your breath—more than 5,000 Bitcoins (yes, that’s correct).

What did Kristoffer do with his investment? Nothing! He moved on with his life and forgot about it. He remembered only when mainstream media started talking about Bitcoin on a daily basis around 2013. After an entire day spent searching for the correct password to his encrypted Bitcoin wallet, Kristoffer struck gold and quickly exchanged one-fifth of his investment for $886,000.

He used the money to buy himself a cozy apartment in Oslo, Norway, and the rest is history. It’s possible that Kristoffer still has the remaining 4,000, patiently waiting for the right opportunity to sell another chunk of his digital fortune.",Kristoffer Koch – Millionaire by Accident,1632497268

Most people get caught up in this news, and it in it temporarily takes all their focus and who could blame them. Yet this is the opportune time to keep across all your chosen projects. Normally big news items get passed over in times like this, and it spells opportunity.

I'm not talking about inconsequential stuff like a SNL skit, or tiny partnerships. I'm talking roadmap milestone completion and consequential partnership announcements.

It puts you into a good position when the market turns back around, instead of sitting on the sidelines you have a much clearer idea of what projects will be seeing healthy pumps in the near future and can invest accordingly. Whereas alot of holders would of missed it.

So by sharing your internet bandwidth you can earn passive income. 

How is that working?  

1. Download the application and install it on the device on which you want to share your internet.   
2. Run the IPRoyal Pawns app, which securely shares your internet connection with no access to personal data.  
3. They will use your connection to gather bits of information from the internet. You can check the business cases to see a more detailed explanation.  
4. You can also earn by participating in their  affiliation program. You can earn additional rewards by inviting other people to join, and you will get 10% of every user payout amount

**Why does anyone need this?**

Why should an ordinary man?  The first one that came to my mind was my friend from Egypt who has limited monthly internet consumption calculated in GB. Apparently, as he tells me, where he lives there is no possibility to pay internet without a limit in GB, so using this can benefit him.

**How much money can you make?**  

You don’t know until you try. Some IP addresses that are in certain countries are going to be used by people there more than in others and the people who share internet will get more money as more people will use their services.   

  
**How are they paying?**

Right now, they offer payouts to Paypal or BTC currency.  Is it safe?  Well here I want to hear your opinions as well. 

  
**Where can I install this app, does it work for mobile phones?**

You can install it on desktop, laptop and Android phones. Right now the app is not supported on iOS devices.

&amp;#x200B;

**Should you install it on multiple devices?**

I think no. Since all of your devices are in the same LAN and have the same public address, the app will see only one IP, not multiple devices.

&amp;#x200B;

**Most important question, is it safe?**

Securely sharing my IP address sounds scary and you wonder if your data can be compromised somehow?  

Well, IPRoyal devs say that the app is built on three core pillars **- security, safety and privacy.**

Here is something from their site that you can read.  

&gt;The app facilitates proxy services to third-party entities, such as data MarsProxies, CloverProxies, and other trustworthy companies.  Is it safe? Yes! Your security is important to us. And we do everything to know our partners!  Read more about the use-cases for IPRoyal on our Blog posts: SEO, travel transport aggregation, advertising industry, brand protection.

Welcome to the monthly recap for the 3rd of 4 homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Funds. The 2020 Portfolio is made up of: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, EOS, Binance Coin, BitcoinSV,** and **Tezos.**

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly. Did the same in 2019, 2020, and 2021. ***Learn more about the Experiment history, rules, and FAQs (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **Top Performer of July** \- **Tezos (+79%)**
* **Overall since Jan. 2020** \- **BNB** up **+3,439%** in 20 months, the best performing of any of the cryptos in any of the four Top Ten Experiments.  Last place is **BSV** \+74%.
* An ode to DCA:  **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning +481%.**

## Month Twenty – UP 847%

https://preview.redd.it/59tbf1izn9p71.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eec61331d2902c6d8a4e6c47ecc28da12ac2b50d

The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, BCH, Litecoin, EOS, BNB, BSV,** and **Tezos**.  

August highlights for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* **First all green month** since [March 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-15/).
* **All cryptos posted double digit gains** this month and **Tezos** won the month.

This group of cryptos also highlights the benefits of an index fund strategy: the **+847%** return of the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio has *outperformed eight of the individual component cryptos contained within the Index.* Only by guessing right and throwing all your eggs into **Ethereum** and/or **Binance Coin** would you have performed better than spreading out the risk, index style.  

## August Movement Report, Ranking, and Dropouts

Only **XTZ** climbed in rank this month.  The other cryptos maintained their positions or slid downward.

Ups:

* **Tezos** – up nine places (#43–&gt;#34)

Downs:

* **BSV** – down six places (#40–&gt;#46)
* **EOS** – down four places (#29–&gt;#33)
* **Bitcoin Cash** – down two places (#12–&gt;#14)
* **Tether** – down two places (#3–&gt;#5)
* **Litecoin** – down one place (#15–&gt;#16)

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**  after twenty months, half of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out:  **EOS**, **BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,** and **Bitcoin Cash** have been replaced by **Cardano,** **Polkadot, Solana, Doge,** and **USDC.**

**EOS** and **Tezos** are out of the Top *Thirty* and **BSV** dropped out of the Top *Forty.*

## August Winners and Losers 

***August Winners*** – **Tezos** (+79%) outperformed the field this month followed closely by **XRP** (+70%).

***August Losers*** –  Besides **Tether**, **BSV** (+20%) underperformed compared to the rest of the 2020 Top Ten field.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After twenty months, here’s a snapshot of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment’s monthly winners and losers: 

https://preview.redd.it/jl42ui13o9p71.jpg?width=408&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b81408ab2dea3a65c0a718d3ed3344502d53381

With five monthly victories, **ETH** leads the pack.  **Tether** has the most monthly losses, always a good sign for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio.

## Overall Update – BNB in the lead, 100% of cryptos in positive territory, 2020 Top Ten best performing of the four Experiments

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio continues to be the best performing of the four [Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 100% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive territory, most have at least *triple digit price growth,* and two cryptos in *four digit growth territory* (**BNB** and **ETH**). **Binance Coin** continues to hold a commanding lead.

The initial $100 investment twenty months ago into first place **Binance Coin**? Currently worth **$3,540**, an increase of +3,439%.    

In second is **Ethereum,** also with quadruple digit gains, up +2,825%.

Besides **USDT**, the worst performer in the 2020 group is **BSV,** up +74% since January 2020. 

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/4cq9kso4o9p71.png?width=499&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10837760d6d417242efe16204280c6896f28517f

The total market finished August at $2.2T, picking up about $623B during the month.  As a sector, crypto is up **+1071%** over the twenty month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.

If you were able to capture the entire crypto market since [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) (+1071%), you’d be doing quite a bit better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+847%) and ridiculously better than the S&amp;P (+40%) over the same time period.  Much more on the S&amp;P below.

The Top Ten index fund strategy has done pretty well up to this point in the experiment: it has outperformed eight of the ten individual cryptos held within the index.  Only by guessing correctly on **ETH** or **BNB** would you have beaten the Top Ten approach.   

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**$185B in May 2020**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: $2.2T now and in [**May 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16/).

## Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/y0j1elx6o9p71.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34654696ca22d130f68ec6bc4df723f3449c58d7

**BitDom** dropped to 42% in August.  It was at 46.6% just [last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-19).  42% is about as low as we’ve seen so far in the 2020 Top Ten Experiment: out of twenty months, **Bitcoin Domination** was only lower [three months ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17).  

For context, here are the high and low points of **BTC** domination over the life of the 2020 Experiment:

Low Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**41.9% in May 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17).

High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.4% in  December 2020**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-1-year-report/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/1725u408o9p71.png?width=358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51ed94e898cd95f87ca0122786185c931890cf40

The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio picked up $2,947 in August and is now worth **$9,471** (+847%) from the initial $1k investment.  For some context, the 2020 hasn’t yet reclaimed an All Time High: this portfolio was worth **$10,5236** just [four months ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16)). 

The 2020 Portfolio remains the best performing of [the four Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 

Below is a month by month ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along:

https://preview.redd.it/bzn2ieb9o9p71.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32ac94c49fbe56f75404487a63c1ed2502131ab8

The portfolio has yet to experience a red month, although a little over a year ago in [March 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/) it came close, returning a COVID induced low of +7%.

**Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios** 

So, where do we stand if we combine four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-44): up 71% (total value $1,708)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-32): up +585% (total value $6,846)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-20): up +847% (total value $9,471)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8): up +422% (total value $5,224)

Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$23,249** ($1,708 + $6,846 + $9,471 + $5,224).

**That’s up +481%** on the combined portfolios.

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

https://preview.redd.it/qmhia7xbo9p71.jpg?width=511&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79b5a86194369b466d20814876677974541e0dc5

***That’s a +481% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st for four straight years***. 

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with traditional markets.  The S&amp;P reached yet another all time high in August, something we’ve seen again and again this year. It has now returned +40% since January 1st, 2020.   

https://preview.redd.it/5rs0tnpdo9p71.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a85eb5b0cf4cf484de6cc414a69e928bd81070ab

That same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1400 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500 instead. 

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning **+847%**. The initial $1k investment in crypto is now worth **$9,471**. 

***That’s a difference of $8,017.***  

***On a $1k investment!*** 

But that’s just 2020. What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,690 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,810 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,400 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,200 today

So, taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,100** ($1,690 + $1,810 + $1,400 + $1,200).

That is up **+50%**[ since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+481%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of 431% ***in favor of crypto.***

To help provide perspective, here’s a quick look at the combined four year ROI for crypto vs. the S&amp;P up to this point.

## Conclusion:

After three down months, the 2020 Top Ten portfolio bounced back with a vengeance in August.  Not quite back to all time high territory, but if September is anything like this month was, that should change by my next report.

For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you.  For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride!

3236,CryptoCurrency,operator139,"I have a friend who is getting into day trading with Crypto, or let's say week trading. He likes to claim he can predict what coins are going to 20x based off Twitter, NFT drops, News, etc. He's actually right I think, somewhat better odds are formidable due to the fact he is looking at current trends and basing his decisions for investments off of that.

My strategy for investing is Hodling, which I know lots of people here know what that is. What I find interesting with people in the Crypto space I see here on Reddit, or with this one friend I know in real life that likes Crypto, we like to make future long term predictions based off the current trends in Crypto. 

""There's no way ___ coin can go to ___ price, it would take _____ market cap.""

I have to disagree. There's not a single way to predict long-term investments. Especially in the Crypto space with how volatile it is.  Look at Ethereum, year over year. 800% gain. Just one example.

One coin is going to do the same thing right now, I am sure of it in a year or more. Which one is it? Who the hell knows. It's a lottery in itself but anyone claiming that ONE coin CAN'T do it is just wrong. Shiba Inu could do it for all we know. Why? They could burn a huge amount of the supply, demand could go insane, there's so many factors at play.

What's even scarier is some coins which are performing amazing right now could have huge delays in roll outs, hacks, funds stolen... and they collpase. Alt coins are super risky long term, but you could even win bigger long term. As others here have said, better get out for when that bear market comes.

This asset class is extremely interesting. If you want to be safe, Bitcoin. If you want to win huge and are feeling lucky, pick 20 alt coins, and chill out for a few years. You could wake up to a Lambo in your garage. Not financial advice of course, but that's the name of the game.","There's no way to predict the future.

3244,CryptoCurrency,Bize97,"Like many others, I want to start developing an exit strategy depending on the market in the coming months. Do I withdraw and accumulate again during a bear market, or shall I hodl and add to my stack. To know what to do, I want to list a few possibilities and if anyone else has theories, or suggestions please comment below. 

This isn’t meant to be an informative post, just some speculation so I can prepare myself first and foremost, if it helps anyone then that’s an added bonus.

1- Parabolic Q4. 
Q4 is known to be bullish for crypto. Both 2013 and 2017 saw 300+% gains and some people are predicting the same again. This would suggest a December peak and then a sudden, or slow and steady bleed out of the price. 
2- Lengthening cycles. 
This theory, I believe is Benjamin Cowen’s. I’m not sure if he made this up, but he certainly is the best advocate for it. This suggest that each bull cycle extends and the returns are slightly less each cycle. This theory would suggest a steady climb until around July 2022. The statistics he provides certainly support this hypothesis and I can’t discredit it so far. 
3- Reduced bear market
I have seen many people talking about how institutional investment, and wider exposure will mean prices won’t crash like we’ve seen before. This is not to say they won’t crash, they almost certainly will, but maybe not sub 20k for example. This possibility could be a sudden crash and a support level for months on end, or a slow drop lasting months, again with a strong support level. In either case, the main point of this is that we would see a bear market which hasn’t had as big of a crash as previously. 

NB: I have nowhere near enough experience to comment on any scenario. This is just some possibilities to help me decide my strategy going forward. Again, if you can think of any other possibilities please state them. 

I know nobody knows what will happen at all. However, being prepared for different outcomes can help us maximise profits, and reduce losses. Let me know what you think.",The possibilities for the next few months.,1632409635

3254,CryptoCurrency,Ram_1979,"I've been understanding  crypto for about a week. I've looking at scalping, swing trading, bots, hold'ing, staking, yield farming, lending. 

All require some decent starting capital. In the order of a few $k. 

1)Scalping: It's just risky. I've been caught in huge dumps a few times and I've only tried it a few times using maybe $20 per time. You can use stop/loss but you will likely lose your capital after 10 or so trades as these tend to be triggered most of the time. 

2) Swing trading: This seems the best option, wait till a downturn like the other day (evergreene default) and buy the dip on a variety of coins or tokens, wait a day or a few days and either sell, look for another dip or hodl.

3)Bots: I've used one bot and you have to have perfect conditions, I.e the price always going up. There is potential with these bots however.

4) Hold'ing: the markets are so volatile that you would be better off swing trading, I.e look for dips caused by crashes and buy these dips, wait a few days and sell, then look for another dip. I'm also very sceptical of the future of crypto, I think a lot of hype but not sure if anyone brave enough to put hundreds of millions into it again. 

5) Staking: This has some potential but like everything else, your buying the token so if the token price drops over time it could likely cancel out any profits you make staking.

6) Yield far: So much ponzi here, its hard to understand how anybody can profit, they last 2 days at most before the token essentially becomes worthless.

Excerpt:

There are hidden chat rooms on the internet, where Cryptocurrency investors and traders build communities, share secrets, and collectively decide what to do with the money that they make.  

You’ll find these rooms on Discord, a messaging app originally designed for gamers that’s quickly become the home of crypto natives in search of the next big thing. And on Solana, the fast-rising Blockchain competitor to Ethereum, you have to use Grape to get through the crypto-gated gates.  

Grape Network is a startup that provides tools for Defi and NFT projects to build, manage, and incentivize formalized communities known as Dao. The company launched just five months ago, and it’s already beginning to position itself as an essential tool on the Solana network. 

Today, Grape announced a $1.2 million seed round led by the Austin-based Multicoin Capital. That’s on top of the $600,000 that it raised in a Token sale last week—the one that generated so much hype and demand from investors, it brought down the entire Solana network.",Grape’s Token Sale Took Down Solana—Now It’s Raising More Money for Its Army of DAOs,1632410056

The Franz Ferdinand moment was when the US Government voted to increase money supply to bailout Tinder, a well know dating app at the time, instead of paying down spiraling debt. 

Most of the outrage at the time was due to the fact that 85% of marriages resulting from the app had failed, however historians contend the divorce rate was actually in line with other dating apps in that era.

Nonetheless, The Climate Wars began and the US came together to put an innovation engine in place the world had never seen before to solve the problem. Much due to the fact the oceans had risen 5 feet and most anti-vaxxers in Florida died from drowning in their homes as they refused to believe ocean waters were rising even as fish and other marine life began swimming into their living rooms.

# What is it?

Harmony is a blockchain that proposes itself as an infrastructure for fast and scalable decentralized applications. Harmony's validation algorithm, called ***Effective Proof-of-Stake*** (EPoS), guarantees complete decentralization thanks to a system that combines stake delegation, compound interest on commissions deriving from participation in the network and double approval for slashing (the penalty imposed on validators that do not behave honestly). The efficiency of the Harmony ONE blockchain makes it suitable for a large variety of decentralized applications, some of which are already up and running:

* **DeFi**: MochiSwap and Viper are two swap platforms that can already boast thousands of users and tens of millions of US dollars in TVL (total value locked, the amount of money deposited), with transactions and farming protocols that benefit from fast transactions and economic.
* **NFT**: the nascent non-fungible-token market has recently also arrived on Harmony ONE, thanks to the daVinci platform, which at the moment has already collected over 740 artists and more than 6000 works in its catalog.
* **Gaming**: even if no decentralized application is yet available, the speed of Harmony's blockchain would be at the center of a partnership with Animoca, the giant in the blockchain gaming sector behind Cryptokitties and which can boast licenses of brands such as Formula 1, Garfield and Atari .

Great emphasis was also placed on making the Harmony blockchain communicating with existing protocols: bridges with the Ethereum blockchain, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon (MATIC) are already active, allowing the creation and exchange of wrapped assets.

# How does it work?

The proprietary token of the Harmony blockchain is ONE, which performs three fundamental functions:

* **Staking**: the token is used for the validation of transactions through the usual Proof-of-Stake mechanism, providing an incentive to users to take part in the network.
* **Fee**: ONE is used to pay for interactions with the Harmony blockchain, making it essential for moving or creating assets.
* **Governance**: ONE owners can vote on the developments of the protocol, thus promoting its decentralization and community participation.  Initially created on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain network, the ONE token was moved to Harmony's proprietary blockchain starting in June 2019, one month after launch on the popular Binance exchange.  The ONE token has a maximum supply of 12,600,000,000 (12 billion and 600 million) and was launched on the market at a price of 0.0065 US dollars.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallets for ONE are TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

I'm at my early 20's and my back is already killing me. 20 and have back problems, fuck me. My family is poor, so for 20 years, I have slept on the floor. And the distance between my back and the floor is just 2 inches of Foam. 

Finally sleeping on a mattress that has like good 8 inches on it feels reaaaaally f*cking good. Like someone transplanted me with a new back, damn, I feel like a new person. I f*ck you not it feels better than seeing my portfolio green after the May Crash. It also let's you sleep real nice even with the FUDs and all the Flash Crashes.


You spend 1/3 of your life, 25 years of your life, lying down on your bed. Might as well spend those 25 years, comfortably.

But the point of this ""advice"" is not really limited to mattresses. We all want to have some ""winning"" investments, but if you really want a ""sure win"" investment, invest on yourself. Invest on things that would make the quality of your life better. I was so focused on building my crypto portfolio now that I forgot the reason I was investing was to make my life better at the first place.

You're forced to HODL your body for 75 years, might as well invest on it.

3276,CryptoCurrency,step11234," *Let me start with the disclaimer that I don't think dogecoin has a big future in the crypto space but will probably stick around as a the top meme coin for a long time. I don't expect good returns for people on this coin except the pumper and dumpers.*

I see a lot of hate for dogecoin as a crypto about how the coin itself will rip people off or ""rugpull"" them. This is just false, the problem you have with dogecoin is not the coin itself, but the community.

The coin is not great, let's be real - it's a copy of litecoin designed to be a joke with no infinite limit on the number of coins. The brand can never be anything more than a joke because it's a picture of an internet meme. It is pretty cheap and fast to send money though, and the brand IS recognizable. It's also a Proof of Work coin so everything is secure and literally cannot be rugged by the devs. It's never going to be a huge crypto other than as a gimmick.

The real problem you should have is with the toxic community surround Doge! The community used to be really fun and generous when the coin was a tiny fraction of the price it was no. Constant tipping, funny memes, they even sponsored a racer at Nascar before crypto sponsors were really a thing.

Then the price started to go up after GME and the whales (who hold large portions of dogecoin) took full advantage of the noobs getting in to pump the price, then we had the Elon SNL sketch &amp; the doge community trying to shill their bags with promises of $1, $10 etc.

There were 2 phrases the community used to used sincerely, now they feel hollow and points:

1. **D**o **O**nly **G**ood **E**veryday - This really encapsulated the doge community spirit in the early days when it truly was about making peoples lives better and having fun.
2. 1 doge = 1 doge - The concept that doge is not about monetary value but to be used as a currency and it's for the community.

Honestly it's sad to see from someone who never really participated in doge as a crypto but saw the good the community did turn into this price obsessed cult.

I recently entered this world and i'm still confused about how, for example, a bitcoin looks like: 

Is it like a alphanumeric string or it exists only as a transaction? 

For example, the miner close the block so there is a transaction of i.e. 1 btc to his wallet (so his wallet balance is now 1 btc), then the miner sells it so it goes to another wallet and this transaction is on the chain, so the wallet of the buyer has now 1 btc.

3321,CryptoCurrency,Asheddit,"TL;DR: Systematically invest in BTC using the Fear &amp; Greed Index for higher returns. Buying when the index is at Extreme Fear is better than your standard weekly or monthly DCAs. Best strategy is to buy on the fifth day of consecutive Extreme Fear days.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started DCAing into BTC once again but seeing the Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index mentioned quite often in the Daily has got me wondering how my fixed monthly buys actually fare against buying based on the F&amp;G Index. Thankfully, their website allows you to export historical data going back to 1 Feb 2018 so I was able to play around with the data to gather some findings. Bitcoin's daily closing price is from CoinGecko.

First of all, let's find some benchmarks based on the traditional weekly and monthly DCA buys. I decided to separate the results based on different yearly timeframes: 2021 only (YTD), 2020 only, 2019 only, and 2018 only (Feb-Dec); as well as looking at longer timeframes: 2020-2021, 2019-2021, and 2018-2021. As September is still ongoing, YTD data is based on Jan-Aug but current value is calculated based on the 21 Sep price.

Here are the results for weekly DCAs based on a particular day of the week:

https://preview.redd.it/lt4onln7i1p71.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78a62ec6c0b0ea3596f678c134eae316e03e24e5

Based on the data here, Friday followed by Wednesday appear to be the best day to DCA although the differences between each day of the week are negligible when looking at longer timeframes.

Below are the results for monthly DCAs based on a fixed date of each month.

https://preview.redd.it/mbqdcj4ej1p71.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=709c25ef064439c571d5811f9534702531a3da02

For monthly DCAs, Day 1 and Day 13 have performed the best since 2018. *Note that months without days 29-31, the last day of the month was used instead.*

Taking the top two choices for weekly and monthly, looks like monthly edges out weekly a little bit.

Next is my analysis of the Fear &amp; Greed Index and how we could potentially take advantage of it to maximize our BTC gains. Logically, the best time to buy is when there's blood in the streets so according to the index, that would be Extreme Fear. I looked at a number of buy strategies that I came up with:

* Buy only on the first day the index changes to Extreme Fear
* Buy every single day the index shows Extreme Fear
* Buy every two days on Extreme Fear
* Buy every three days on Extreme Fear
* Buy every four days on Extreme Fear
* Buy every five days on Extreme Fear
* Buy every six days on Extreme Fear
* Buy every seven days on Extreme Fear

Basically, when you get X consecutive days of Extreme Fear, you would continue buying at that specific interval you've chosen. When the F&amp;G is no longer in Extreme Fear mode, the above rules reset. I also tested the same based on buying on Fear OR Extreme Fear, which of course should be the less favorable option but give you more buying opportunities. Below are the results.

https://preview.redd.it/a4jfaffxo1p71.png?width=884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3485ed3a44b077057ad842bee06794599e94d512

Buying every five days when the index is at Extreme Fear appears to be the outright winner here. The clear outlier is the *Extreme Fear (Every 7 Days)* in 2019 where it returned only 0.77% when the other strategies were able to achieve 30%+. This is because there was only one instance of seven consecutive days of Extreme Fear so you were only limited to one buying opportunity in the whole of 2019.

As you can see, based on historical data, buying the dip based on the Fear &amp; Greed Index versus casually DCAing on a weekly or monthly basis will undoubtedly result in better ROI. However, buying opportunities will be more scarce so extreme patience will be necessary when applying this strategy.

Finally, I understand that we're just looking at somewhat limited data from only Feb 2018 and it might be better if more data was available going back to 2013 or earlier. On the other hand, 2018-2021 could also be a better representation of today's market and it also includes a lengthy bear market as well as the recent/current bull market.

Having a fixed DCA schedule is undoubtedly the easiest option and will still give you great returns but you could effectively time the market a little bit by using the publicly available Fear &amp; Greed Index to maximize those gains.","Weekly vs. Monthly vs. ""Extreme Fear"" DCA Comparisons - Using the Fear &amp; Greed Index to maximize your BTC ROI",1632322519

3327,CryptoCurrency,themop1,"OK so this crypto hits every check box.  It's Proof-of-Stake.  It has 25 percent of the transactions that ETH has presently.  It has a market cap 1/100th of ETH.  It costs pennies to send the crypto.  Gas fees are pennies.  Huge growth.  The market has just beaten down the price by about 40 percent to boot.  Valuation websites are saying that based on its growth it should be worth 3x its current market cap already.  

Here's the thing about ETH that no one wants to talk about seriously.  Sure it has the most projects but those projects are put in handcuffs by the very high gas fees.  It should not cost 50 dollars to move a coin.  So if I am a new developer why would I pick ETH as a platform to host my APP or Project?  What is the only advantage it has?  Size.  It's a big elephant with a lot of people pumping money into it because they assume size means it can't be taken down.  It absolutely can be taken down.  You're going to see projects moving ERC-20 coins entirely over to Tezos soon.  Because the odds go up that their project will be usable by people looking to use it a lot.  

For instance.  I had a token called AMP that is hosted on ETH.  I wanted to stake the coin but decided I would feel trapped if I did.  It shouldn't be expensive to stake a coin and then unstake a coin in short period of time.  Our NFT projects are all selling out on Oneof.  Tezos is going to 100 billion market cap and ETH is close to its peak market cap.  Do you want something that can do 20x or 3x?  The answer is pretty obvious.  Maybe if ETH could move to Proof of Stake immediately they would stand a chance.

3329,CryptoCurrency,CrappingCrypto,"Hey all,

I recently received my coinbase card and have been considering using that instead of our main rewards card which is our Costco card.  I'm trying to figure out if we should stick with an average cashback of 1.5% (Costco) or put that into crypto for a possible greater return.   We pay our card off in full every month.

[Screenshots for Coinbase rewards and our YTD Costco rewards](https://imgur.com/a/8DZ10ET)

We've spent about $50k this year which is about double our normal spending because we replaced our HVAC and are in the middle of a kitchen reno.  If I only looked at what bitcoin did over this last year which is +300%, then that $500 in BTC 1% is now $2000, more than 3x the $700 we have YTD from Costco, but obviously that growth is from the start and as we spend throughout the year so does BTC rise (usually).

The other thing to consider is because it's debit I might need to constantly monitor the amount of cash in there which could get annoying.  Unless of course I choose to pay using Tezos (not USD) and keep money in Tezos which also earns 4.63% APY, which could be a benefit while the money sits there waiting to be spent....so now I'm getting more confused. :-)

So anyway, I'm having a hard time with all the different options.  If anyone has a better way to present a comparison of returns to me so that I could look at it and propose the switch to my wife, I would love to see it!

Side note:  This is actually the first time I've really looked at the amount we've spent, as normally I'm only seeing it month to month.

I trade crypto daily using centralised exchanges and peer2peer exchanges, i trade purely for myself as an individual to build up my personal portfolio. This is also my only income at the moment. I'm not bragging but my volume is quite high (I wont share specifics for obvious reasons). 

I use one bank for my crypto activities and another for my day to day life (bills and stuff). The bank I use for my crypto trading is called Rabobank, this is a dutch bank. Today a lady from this bank called me to ask me to stop immediately with what I am doing or they will block my account. This because the activity on my account seems more like business related (there is a lot of activity due to arbitrage between exchanges etc). I asked them if in that case i could switch to a business account (even though I am doing this as an individual). They told me they do not open accounts for crypto related businesses....

This is not the first time a bank has called me regarding my crypto activities, but this is the first time they told me to stop it. On previous occasions the banks would merely suggest that crypto is high risk and maybe not a good idea. But this bank just blatantly told me to quit what I am doing. They basically told me to stop making a living the way i am doing it now. I do not know how you would react to that but that one really triggered me and i told the lady what she would say if someone would call her and tell her to quit her job(maybe a bit childish but i was really triggered)?

I was under the impression that I live in a country with lots of personal freedom (the Netherlands). But if it is up to Rabobank they would gladly impede on this personal freedom of mine to do whatever I want with MY money (as long as it is not illegal) by excluding me from the banking system.

I know this seems like a rant and maybe it is but I am very pissed of at this. I can not believe that they had the audacity to tell me and force me to spend my money differently.

I contacted several lawyers, and the basic gist is that banks can do whatever they want. With the new anti money laundering rules in Europe banks are under pressure from the government to do their due diligence. This legislation comes at the cost of people like me, people who make money in a non traditional way. I am basically guilty until proven innocent because the bank does not have the capability to check wether all my transactions are legit or not.

This move from Rabobank has me a little bit worried for the future of crypto in Europe. While they are not prohibiting crypto so far, they are making it limited by allowing banks like Rabobank to just cancel your activities because you trade crypto. And I know that I am a major minority(in the way I use my bank account) but while I am not doing anything illegal i do not understand how a bank can prohibit me from using my money the way i see fit.",Today my bank called me...,1632324002

DirectedIRA - [https://directedira.com/cryptocurrency/](https://directedira.com/cryptocurrency/) \- Costs seem competitive and you get a Gemini account for trading. Also can set up a self directed LLC option that lets you do trading on exchanges as you see fit and hold your own cryptos in your wallet etc. Seems like a smaller company but they put out good educational info.

Choice by Kingdom Trust - [https://www.retirewithchoice.com/](https://www.retirewithchoice.com/) \- Leaning toward them for now. Exchange account is built on Kraken primarily .

Have options for leaving on exchange, cold storage through Fidelity Digital Assets, or self holding your keys.

But for CRP it is different. It has gained popularity for its totally anonymized and fully decentralized behavior. Anyone can go and check its rank on CMC for starters.

Tezos  blockchain has received its newest upgrade proposal for the global  Tezos community. The Hangzhou proposal sets the Tezos ecosystem up for  the upcoming 2022 consensus upgrade and also introduces a number of new  technical tools and patches.

The proposal was named after the global technology and innovation hub  located in China—Zhejiang province. The update was presented with the  usage of on-chain governance that allows network updates without hard  forks.

The constant development of Tezos at the protocol level has led to  the expansion of Tezos' Dapp system. By decreasing transaction costs and  time, builders have more possibilities for building and developing apps  on top of the Tezos blockchain. In general, it has led to the increased  growth of the Tezos community in recent months. Recently, Tezos reached  over three million contract calls and set numerous records in DeFi and  NFT metrics, doubling last month's results.

The most recent upgrade proposal brings several major upgrades to the  protocol. The new upgrade presents views that offer the possibility for  smart contracts to read other smart contracts and cache results with  lower gas costs. The upgrade will also add a Global Table of Constants  that will be used to allow smart contract developers to register  Michelson expressions as constants. This means that they will be able to  build more complex contracts and libraries based on Tezos.

To optimize the functioning of smart contracts on the network, the  upgrade brings Context Flattening, which allows optimization of block  processing and operations. In addition to that, the network welcomes  Liquidity baking, which allows for a more stable transition to the next  upgrade proposal.

Tezos already has seven upgrades since last month's Granada upgrade.  The network has also faced a record number of interactions than ever  before, which means that more people are using Tezos. The main reason  for this is protocol upgrades that are possible through on-chain  governance.

The Hangzhou proposal was developed by Marigold, DaiLambda, Nomadic Labs, Tarides and Oxhead Alpha.

Leverage Trade without Risk Management.. A Quick (Painful) Story”

Background: 
I’m still a newbie, only being invested in crypto for about 9 months. I’ve grown from yoloing into Doge at 7 cents to DCA and hodling Top 10 coins (with a couple lower cap still in the Top 100).

Story time:
After trading a percentage of my portfolio and only seeing minor gains, I found an awesome project on KuCoin that gives back great passive income. The issue is I needed $500 to reach my goal number of coins.

I transfer $2000 into my margin account to try to quickly get the extra 25%. It starts off smooth, already up $250 with an ADA long. The next day, my stop loss hits and I’m down $100. This is where the disasters start. 

Now, I start getting aggravated I didn’t take profit off the trade and ended up losing out. Revenge trading ensues. 

I start using more money in each trade to make back the small loss and get to my goal. Down another $150 and here comes AVAX. Promising project, already had a bullish run and looks like it’s bouncing off support so I buy in. This time, I’m confident I can trade my money back so instead of a stop loss, I set lower buy limits. These buy limits hit throughout the day and now I’m 5% (or 25% using the 5x leverage) from being liquidated. 

I remember it like it was yesterday, because it was just 2 weeks ago, my girlfriend and I planned a nice day of little dates to the zoo then the movies. An hour into the zoo, my phone blows up saying my AVAX account was liquidated $750. 

A flow of emotions run rampant through me, but I look up and see her ecstatic because the elephants were walking towards us so she could get a better picture! (She loves bringing her Canon camera everywhere to never miss a moment). Even with the thought of losing over a weeks paycheck in a couple days due to stupid decisions, I couldn’t help but smile at her happiness and a moment of bliss passes over me.

It was at this moment I realized how emotionally invested I was in crypto when I should save my emotions for the people that matter.

# What is it?

Stellar Lumens is a blockchain that aims to speed up and make money transactions in different currencies cheaper.  Launched in 2015, it has already seen nearly 500 million operations carried out on its blockchain. Transfers are possible thanks to the mediation of the Lumen token.  Stellar Lumens is characterized by its speed and low commissions.

# How does it work?

Every time a deposit is made within the network, new tokens are issued in a 1: 1 ratio.  People who use this system have a wallet at their disposal that can also be put in contact with their own home banking. In addition to making payments to other bank accounts, those who receive the tokens will also be able to exchange them for traditional currency.  Therefore, Stellar Lumens acts as an intermediary between two operators, but without the costs and waiting times that traditional ones usually employ.  The geographical borders between the different countries are thus demolished, allowing anyone to exchange money and make purchases easily.  The Stellar Blockchain monitors ownership, acting as an authentic accounting “ledger”, controlled by a network of independent computers that check the records every five seconds.  The algorithm used is the ""***Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP)***"", designed to work with any type of traditional currency. The forwarding of balances and transactions takes place every 5 seconds and the cost of each transaction is quite low: 0.00001 dollars. Think instead of the commissions charged by banks or money transfers for the same operations.  The ""nodes"" of the blockchain are represented by servers, which run the ""core software"" of the network, taking care of publishing and checking the registry.  Each time an operation is scheduled, the nodes verify that the right amount of tokens has been debited/credited.  A copy of all transactions carried out within the blockchain is also kept inside the servers.  The Stellar network is made up of hundreds of nodes around the world, which communicate with each other through a shared algorithm and software. It is therefore impossible to attack the blockchain with cyber attacks of the ""denial of service"" type. Stellar Lumens is also distinguished by the fact that it can connect itself to the endpoints to be converted into fully spendable traditional currency.  The blockchain already enjoys several important partnerships, such as IBM, basically the longest-running American computer company in business.

if you want to support the enviroment, electric cars and crypto, **this** could definitely be something for you!

A startup company here in Austria established a car sharing platform with electric cars (tesla &amp; bmw i3) only. Currently, they have ""tokenized"" 11 tesla cars of the fleet, which means that people all around the globe have the oppurtunity to invest in their token (EOT) and be a active ""shareholder"" of the company.  
The sales of the tokenized cars are splitted 50/50 with the company and all token holders / shareholders, so you have a good oppurtunity to start your passive income with blockchain and car sharing combined. The tokens are very limited ... you can only buy EOT when a new car gets tokenized.  
(Announcements regarding token sales are made on their Instagram page and their Telegram group.)

For your info:  
1 Tesla = **85000** **EOT**  
1 EOT = € 1,10

They try to make everything as transparent as possible for token holders. (you can see sales and losses of every day and car, which cars are currently booked, out of service and so on ...) -&gt; see picture

If you want to become a token holder, you have to sign up [here](https://eloop.one/) and complete KYC.

The normal car sharing app can be downloaded in the app store.  
They have very fair prices and good conditions (also for multiple day journeys), so feel free to use ELOOP when coming to Austria/Vienna. (soon maybe also in your country)

In my opinion this is a great idea and i love driving with these teslas. (if you buy EOT, you also get a good amount of free credits for the carsharing app, so you can drive and test them for free)

For those of you that don't know, Boba Network is OMG’s L2 Optimistic Rollup Solution. It is similar to Optimism and Arbitrum, but added features including native fast exits, staking, hybrid compute, NFT minting and bridges, and a token.

Boba tokens will also be for their DAO governance.

3502,CryptoCurrency,CuntyMcGiggles,"Obviously waking up to see a see of bloody red wasn’t the best feeling this morning. My portfolio is down 28% from this time yesterday. That sucks. But other than sticking to my long-term plan of hodling and short-term plan of DCAing, there’s literally nothing I can do. 

The crypto space can be emotional. Especially when you’re knee-deep in it like we are in this sub. Living off hopium and green dildos. But is there anything we can do? No, there isn’t. Other than keep our eyes on the long-term goal and keep on keeping on. 

No amount of worry or anxiety or checking the charts will change what the charts will do. Unless you’re a whale holding 100s of BTC, we can only hang on and keep our eyes on the prize.

I didn't intend for these to come from the same source, but both articles use the same buzz word: 'surge'. That's indeed what it was, a price surge which led to a really impressive global market cap for crypto.

As of time of writing, CoinGecko has the global market cap of crypto sitting at $2.021 trillion!

On the **31st of December** Ethereum's average trading price was **$737.8**; it **surpassed $1000** in value for the first time since February of 2018 on **4th January 2021**. 

At the time of writing, ETH has a value of **$3,078.69** and briefly surpassed $4000 a little earlier this month, having last surpassed that value in May. **It is over 4x its value on the last day of 2020,** and we still have just over 3 months of 2021 remaining.

SOL is up over 88x (which is ridiculous) since its average trading **value of $1.6034 on 01/01/2021.**

# What is it?

VeChain is a blockchain with  a toolkit for the development of Dapps, which wants to offer to large companies a valid infrastructure for the control of their supply chains, as well as for the development of blockchain projects with a cost that can be assessed before implementation.  The control can take place at different levels and also through compatible hardware, which has allowed VeChain, as we will deepen later, to already support different industries - and with equally different needs.

* **A blockchain**: VeChain is first of all a blockchain, which works through a particular consensus algorithm, based on the authority of the nodes. The blockchain that is offered by VeChain - and of which VET is the reference token - is powerful, offers very low cost transactions and, more importantly, offers full development possibilities.
* **A toolkit**: VeChain doesn't just offer a blockchain. It also offers a corollary of decentralized app development tools. This is one of the keys to VeChain's success, at least among the very large companies.  Those who marry this project have at their disposal not only a performing blockchain, but also programming tools developed for the same blockchain by the same company that animates it.
* **Hardware**: However, perhaps the most relevant feature of the entire VeChain project is the possible integration with hardware, also developed by the same company. This allows you to implement projects that, for example, can trace the originality of a product.  Or that they can follow the mechanical and electrical life of a car - which among other things has already been implemented by major car brands such as BMW. Integration with hardware is a decidedly specific feature that separates the VeChain project from what is possible even for blockchains that would like to offer services similar to those of VET.
* **An Ecosystem**: VeChain aims to be an entire ecosystem, within which there should be everything that could be useful for companies and developers to create applications, supply chain tracing, control systems. The project continues to develop new features and offer new creative outlets to those who want to use it. The existence of this blockchain is perhaps second to none, even to projects that have hit the market more recently.

# How does it work?

VeChain is a *sui generis* blockchain, which uniquely implements the characteristics that we are used to seeing on projects of this type. It will therefore be necessary to further investigate the unique aspects of this network, also to be able to understand its future functionalities and potential:

* **VeChainThor**: It starts as a public blockchain and, according to the project coordinators, it aims at mass adoption, with a specific focus in terms of small, medium and large enterprises. The service, it should be remembered, was initially born with the intent of an Ethereum project, and then moved to its own network in 2018. The reason for the change is the impossibility, for Ethereum, to support large-scale commercial projects, even in terms of Dapps.
* **A governance structure devoted to business**: If it is true that Ethereum supports Dapps, it is equally true that a governance system such as the one implemented by VeChain lends itself more to the needs of companies and commercial applications. The governance of the VeChain project also aims to offer companies a cost plan that can always be calculated in advance, an aspect on which the Ethereum networks for the moment are still very unreliable.
* **Support for smart contracts:** Which is borrowed directly from Ethereum's EVM system. At this point of the series, we all know what smart contracts are. The fact remains that, although the project claims to be focused on the adoption by as many people as possible of an integrated blockchain system, in reality it can mainly meet the needs of large companies.
* **Proof of Authority system**: The system chosen by VeChain is called Proof of Authority, and is a system that allows you to verify transactions thanks to masternodes, or nodes that have a particular status within the network. To become validators within VeChain you need to block an important amount of tokens and above all verify your identity. This makes validators particularly reliable, even if it plays against the decentralization of the system.
* **A foundation behind the project:** Behind the entire project there is a foundation that manages both the development and the commercial expansion attempts of the project. For the moment, the commercial governance model has proved extremely valid and has allowed the project to forge important collaborations with groups such as LVHM, but also BMW, Renault, DeCecco, PwC and many others.  It is not uncommon that behind the major blockchain and cryptocurrency projects there are very articulated commercial realities. In a system that is enterprise focused like VeChain this has turned out to be, at least for the moment, a good thing.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallets for VET are Sync, VeChainThor Wallet, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

* Great blockchain
* Low fees and fast transactions
* Passive income just by holding VET in the official wallet
* Real use cases and concrete projects
* Great tokenomics

**Cons**

[https://longforecast.com/bitcoin-pri...019-btc-to-usd](https://longforecast.com/bitcoin-price-predictions-2017-2018-2019-btc-to-usd)  


Previous halving cycles, 2012-2016 and 2016-2020, BTC hit an ATH in 13months (Dec 2013) and 18 months (Jan 2018), then entered a long consolidation until the next halving. These guys are forecasting BTC to not hit an ATH until end of Q1 2023, peaking at just over $180K... which is nice and all, but seems a lot longer into the cycle than most expect (ATH coming almost 3 years after the halving), leaving little time for consolidation before the next halving date, and a much smaller pullback to around $63K in midyear 2025, a full year after the 2024 halving takes place. I know past performance is no guarantee yada yada, but it does seem to follow a pattern, or it has anyway, as evidenced by the S2F model and how it has tracked along that model's prediction so far.

I was kinda' anticipating a peak and then pullback into a bear market sometime in 2022... maybe the bull market lasting into 2023 (they forecast ETH to not reach ATH around 16K until several months later in 2023) is a sign that the ""supercycle"" hype is becoming reality...

For reference, [this](https://i.redd.it/3aujs9fofbn71.jpg) comic from /u/srgrafo takes up 394 kb.

If you want to know my opinion on MINA, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/preqvo/new_coin_deep_dive_mina_protocol_the_smallest/hdk0dv4/). Safe to say that I'm not happy with their marketing of a ""small fixed-size blockchain"", when the supposed ""blockchain"" is just a zkSnark proof &amp; a trimmed merkle tree. Unless you're a ""block propagator"" or a ""snarker"", the ""blockchain"" contains **none** of the current state. The ""blockchain"" is effectively useless without the current state to pair up with it.

[From a comment reply that I made in the same thread:](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/preqvo/new_coin_deep_dive_mina_protocol_the_smallest/hdkdgmk/)

&gt; The most fundamental thing in the universe is that everything is information in some form, and that black holes are formed when a lot of matter (i.e information) is brought into a finite space. What Mina's suggesting via their marketing is that they've created a blackhole blockchain, by claiming that everything can fit in 22kb.

3560,CryptoCurrency,Scary_Milk,"""By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is  noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by  experience, which is the bitterest."" - Confucius

There are many people out there that are after our precoius coins and tokens. Maybe we can get some wisdom here by reflection and not experience and be prepared when the scam attempts happen. 

So let's share our scam experiences, attemped and successful ones, everything that can help spotting them and tipps for keeping them out of the way. 

I'll go first: 

I once invested in a coin that was shilled for weeks on a certain imageboard, thought I was really early and then suddenly the shilling stopped, there was no more liquidy and I couldn't cash out. A classical rug pull.   
Wasn't that much and I learnt my lesson, if something is only tradable on uniswap, you have to be very careful and do a lot of research about the project first.

My next scam is phishing mails. I have the honor to be one of the people that were exposed in the Ledger leak, I bought a Ledger Nano S in 2018 from their official website because I thought it would be the most secure thing to do. Long story short: There was a leak with my full home adress, phone number and email exposed. That's really horrible as it is linked to the fact that I'm into crypto. So I get a lot of emails with phishing links, emails looking like they are from coinbase, some that are from link foundation or XRP asking me to update my coins through a special website. Some look really poor while others are extremely professional. There are also SMS and phone calls.   
It's not that hard since I just don't open any emails with anything crypto in it. I have all my coins and tokens in my own hardware wallet, so there is no need for anyone to every contact me about anything and every attempt is most likely either an advertisement or a scam attempt.

This means that if you owe $10,000 in taxes from your staking rewards, and then the value of your crypto goes to $0.  You can only write off $3,000 from it bringing your taxes owed to $7,000.  This means getting staking rewards could actually make you OWE more money than you gain.

Please take notice that this a very personal story but I have decided to share it as it may help someone out there who struggled as hard as I did.

It all first started when I was 16. I was a big football fan (soccer for Americans) and consequently I thought I knew everything about the sport. Unfortunately, I was wrong (as expected). Back then, I was young and naive, making me lose a lot of money betting on the sport. I was completely addicted. It wasn't anymore about doing it for fun, it was about chasing a dream which was impossible to achieve as gambling is as we all know a way to simply enrich the bookies.

I struggled a lot with this. Days would go by in which I would not go near the betting apps/websites, but in very slow days where I was home reflecting I would end up betting again. It was unavoidable. I was stuck in this vicious cycle.

Gladly, around 1 year ago I first got into crypto. This would be the event that would finally put an end to my gambling addiction. Crypto gave something to look for, as betting was not on my mind anymore. Of course this was a slow process, but not I prefer to entertain myself looking at charts than at odds in a rigged sports betting website. I got to thank this community too, as spending time here helps ease my mind (even when I have to read absolutely ridiculous things ahaha).

# What is it?

Algorand (ALGO) was founded in 2017 by a MIT professor and Turing Award winner Silvio Micali in 2017 and the project's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is Steve Kokinos, a Boston-based technology executive who is co-founder and former CEO of Fuze. The company behind the development of the project is Algo Capital.  Algorand raised $ 4 million in a seed funding round in February 2018 whose investors included Pillar and Union Square Ventures. The latter is one of the most successful venture capital fcompanies whose investments include Coinbase, Duolingo, Kickstarter, Protocol Labs and Twitter. In October 2018, Algorand raised $ 62 million from 30 global investment groups, including Polybius Capital, NEO Global Capital and Eterna Capital.  The decision to reach a large group of investors around the world was motivated by a desire to encourage development globally, according to Kokinos. It also launched a testnet right after the seed funding. 2019 was a year of rapid progress for the team. In January, the team released ***Algorand Vault***, an official wallet that reduces the cost of storing on the blockchain and distributes across the network without sacrificing security and lowers the entry barrier for network access. Q1 also saw them release Software Developer Kits (SDKs) for Go and JavaScript. This was followed by the opening of the testnet to the public, ahead of the first auction in June, which officially signaled the launch of the Algorand mainnet. Several teams also announced that they would build on the Algorand platform.  Algorand has a fundamental purpose for its existence: to improve the foundations of the current blockchain paradigm to provide what the team believes will be the most suitable base layer for the future of blockchain-related development. First, it intends to do this with a consensus algorithm that defines Proof-of-Stake.  The name of the project derives from the “algorithmic randomness it uses… to choose a set of verifiers who are in charge of building the next block of valid transactions”. Algorand is a direct response to computational inefficiency and the trend of the Bitcoin-work test to lead to the centralization of mining.  Beyond Bitcoin. Algorand's whitepaper references other solutions, most notably Ouroboros: a secure stall-proof Blockchain protocol, otherwise known as a consensus solution for the Cardano project (which is also heavily focused on a scientific approach).

# How does it work?

The whole approach is based on the idea of ​​removing the technical obstacles behind the growth of the blockchain: scalability, centralization and security issues. These are widely seen as the main obstacles preventing the blockchain from entering traditional adoption, among a few others.  There are two other technical points to note with respect to the Algorand architecture. First, the probability of hard forks on the Algorand blockchain is unrealistically small, so each block is effectively finalized upon validation. Second, there is no monetary incentive, as there are no symbolic rewards for generating blocks, for nodes.  The team plans to use the platform as a payment system, but the network also supports smart contracts. The Algorand team has published several whitepapers, with the original as basis for the network. Other whitepapers focus on scaling, governance, blockchain compression, and digital signatures. All these documents have been peer reviewed. The Algorand code is available for the more tech savvy. Algorand already has a diverse roster of partners that span the world. These partners span a wide range of industries, including financial services firms, cryptocurrency firms, venture capital firms, and more. For a project that has only recently emerged, Algorand has done an extraordinary job of bringing entities to its platform. The partnerships themselves cover a variety of different uses.  Specifically, Algorand partnered with the Securitize platform focused on digital securities in September 2019. The partnership focuses on supporting the Securitize protocol on the Algorand blockchain. This offers users of the former “the ability to issue, trade and execute corporate actions using digital securities” on the Algorand blockchain.  Stablecoin Tether (USDT) has also integrated with the Algorand protocol, a move both sides claim to facilitate interoperability and collaboration. AssetBlock, a real estate startup employing blockchain-based solutions, is also working with Algorand to offer investors access to low-cost real estate investment opportunities with high return potential.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallets for ALGO are Algorand Wallet, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

3636,CryptoCurrency,Yocantseeme,"So far, September has been anything but uneventful. As volatile as the markets have been, there are still a few things that you need to have on your radar over the coming weeks.
 
First and foremost, regulators are continuing their crackdown on crypto, specifically stablecoins and crypto lending and borrowing. The FED and Treasury really don’t like dollars floating around that they can't control.
 
Meanwhile, Wall Street doesn't like the billions of dollars flooding into interest bearing stablecoins on platforms like Celcius and Coinbase, the former of which is now feeling the heat in 3 US states. As I mentioned a few weeks ago, this was likely to happen in the wake of the moves by these states to clamp down on BlockFi.
 
Whether we are likely to see a national move by the SEC on crypto lending and stablecoins depends on whether they are likely to get given any special powers in congress. Many in congress have already been working with the SEC to see what sort of powers they are able to give (see Gary’s testimony section below).
 
In terms of timeline, I don’t expect much to happen until they have voted on that infrastructure bill and it looks like the official date for that will be September the 27th.
 
Naturally, there are other concerning things for crypto popping up at the last minute, namely an additional anti-crypto provision in the infrastructure bill that was missed by crypto analysts. I mean, who can blame them? The damn thing is over 2700 pages long and written in legal speak!
 
But, in a nutshell, this oversight provision means US citizens will have to report any crypto transaction they received that's worth more than $10 000. Obviously that's a problem, because this involves collecting personal information on the sender, which is impossible with DeFi protocols.
 
As a cherry on top, we have this Evergrande situation happening in China. I've talked about it before and gave a summarised breakdown in this Telegram post. Apart from the risks around general global market contagion, there are also concerns about what impact it could have on the commercial paper market. As we know, stablecoin issuers like Tether hold almost half of all their assets in this commercial paper. I will be doing a complete video on it so be sure to keep those eyes peeled.
 
It’s not all doom and gloom though. There are a number of positive developments within the crypto space.
 
Institutions are still looking to increase their exposure to the crypto space. We have recently had the news that Fidelity held a private meeting with the SEC where they were pushing the case for their Bitcoin ETF. This is important because Fidelity is one of the largest asset managers in the world and perhaps the most well known applicant for an ETF.
 
Surprisingly enough, Fidelity believes that Bitcoin belongs in the same safe haven category as precious metals and bonds. The global asset manager has also been making numerous positive overtures towards Bitcoin, some of which I covered in my video on Fidelity’s recent research report.
 
Over in the altcoin space, we have the news that Avalanche has just raised over $230m to jumpstart its Defi ecosystem. This now places the project on par with Solana when it comes to firepower. They both have unique tech stacks and it will be interesting to see their ecosystems evolve in the coming months.
 
So, despite all the Global Macro risks and regulatory headaches, the crypto ecosystem is still growing and it's the latter that I am focused on in the long term. It’s important to be optimistic about the future without being blinded to certain risks.",📈 Thoughts on Market 📈,1632064793
3642,CryptoCurrency,redriverdolphin,"I recently posted this thread with feeless in the title so had to repost. Will it ever in your opinion become NEAR feeless? Of course, validators need to be paid, nothing is free - I understand. 

Yes it hasn't fully transitioned to proof of work. Yes l2 solutions are available, however relying on l2 compromises security. I'm just wondering if any Ethereum itself on chain could be near feeless in the future. Perhaps it will always have fees that are unappealing, even if that means only a dollar on gas. 

If near feeless in the future, it could retain control as the no2 or no1 ranked coin on the market for a very long time, so I'm wondering if this is possible considering that gas fees are extortionate rn. Like could the fees come down that much?! 

Do you in your opinion believe that this is the future for ethereum or will new near feeless blockchains eventually overtake it?

However, it's an interesting element all the same. And many gamers pretty much blame crypto miners all the same.

I noticed this active discussion on the pcgaming reddit. There is still a large group of gamers that look with disgust towards mining, GPU-wise.

The other aspect that is interesting is what will happen after Ethereum turns POS. Is POW here to stay, albeit in a more environmental friendly way perhaps? Since that is also one issue mentioned a lot. Or is it doomed to end someday. Will miners flock to other perhaps more efficient POW alternatives? I have heard mention of Ergo or Ravencoin a few times if miners move on to other projects. Ergo claims to aleviate some issues at least.  *""Ergo has made some modifications to alleviate this issue. Its mining  algorithm, called Autolykos, is designed to be resistant to both large  mining pools and ASICs, the devices used to mine Bitcoin.

His analogy was that for Bitcoin to hit $1,500,000 it will need a $100 Trillion Market cap but unfortunately that money is not even available in the whole world.

But look, Bitcoin price is not only determined by supply and demand but also mining difficulty. What if Bitcoin miners decide to sell their Bitcoin for $1,500,000 then because the mining difficulty would have tripled from today’s figures? Your guess is as good as mine! Another reason for my speculation is that by then central bank reserves will be hodling more Bitcoin and less gold. Mark you there are only 21,000,000 Bitcoin that can be mined. That time I see the whole world from persons to institutions grappling to acquire Bitcoin that would be very scarce!

Ancient history atm.

[PC gamer article](https://www.pcgamer.com/rip-cheap-graphics-cards/)

However, that said: there is a lot more to it than meets the eye. The current problems on the GPU market for PC's isn't just because of mining and the scalping, it's one element of a lot more elements currently clouding the market that contributes to it. However, it's an interesting element all the same. The PC market has had an upturn for the last few years and the percentage of gamers playing on Steam has been steadily increasing since 2013. So the demand is also considerably higher than ever before. 

The other aspect that is interesting is what will happen after Ethereum turns POS. Is POW here to stay concerning other coins, albeit in a more environmental friendly way perhaps? Since that is also one issue mentioned a lot. Or is it doomed to end someday. Will miners flock to alternatives? I have heard mention of Ergo or Ravencoin a few times when or if miners move on to other projects.

x) twice a week looking at willy woo and will clemente Twitter and scroll reddit via top posts last 7 days.  (1,5h)

x) once a day checking prices and news on coinmarketcap and cointelegraph (1,5h)

x) other reddit subs and yt videos (1,5h)

I  am relatively new to crypto and have a question regarding Binance  Leveraged Coins. I have noticed that in the past there were instances  where the value of some Binance leveraged coins have jumped massively in  a very short space of time (10s of thousands of percent). So far I  understand this is due to rebalancing of the underlying fund.

My  question is: if one were to invest say $10 just before this were to  occur, would one make a very large profit? Or do the fees associated  with the coin increase during rebalancing to prevent this?

I  somehow can't imagine that everybody with significant holdings of the  coin in that snapshot of time instantly becomes a millionaire overnight  should rebalancing occur. However, I couldn't find any information  specific to this issue on the Binance website.

3721,CryptoCurrency,R0B0C0P33,"I've gotten very into cryptocurrency in the last year, but most people I talk to about it, consider it a scam. I get it, I really do. If you are a person of average or below average technology understanding (which is most people) you probably don't understand the tech involved. Your eyes might glaze over when you hear terms like ""blockchain"" and ""smart contracts""

Also, if you have been using fiat for your entire life, you would naturally be very skeptical of a completely different form of paying for things. It certainly doesn't help that a lot of the times cryptocurrency is in the news, it's because an exchange got hacked. If that's your first impression of crypto, no wonder you'd want to stay clear. Even if you've heard stories of people who got into Bitcoin early and made crazy money, that can sound like a pyramid scheme where only the first few people made money. So, I really do get the skepticism.

I think one of the best ways to normalize cryptocurrency is for the average person to know someone who has/uses crypto. I know some people say to never discuss it with friends/family, but it's all in how you do it. If you tell them ""crypto's the future"" and push them too hard, you can come across as a cult member. Just mention casually that you've had success with it and can see long term potential gains, without sounding like you are trying to recruit them or sell them something.

This is especially true if you are in a position to invest money, which massive portions of the population really aren't. On the harmless end of it your friends may ask for advice, which is fine if you want to give general advice but when you go talking specific investments that's where you will lose. Once you tell someone to invest in something and that investment loses money you will damage your friendship.  Even if that investment loses money for a short time and recovers your friend will remember the loss and the time you put their money in danger. 

Then there is the jealousy factor. Chances are if you are investing, you are doing better than most of your friends financially. At least here in America most people have a very basic retirement account through work and not much or nothing beyond that.  If they know you have more beyond the very basics they are going to assume you are very well off.  This can lead to jealousy or even putting you in the bad situation were a friend may want to borrow money from you. Never do that btw. 

I know this is all really basic to most of us, but I know there are a lot of younger people and people new to investing and wealth building here and I just thought I'd share my cardinal rule of investing.

3740,CryptoCurrency,GranPino,"SUMMARY: If you shut down all BTC mining today, the renewable electricty produced would be the same, and all reduction would be in less coal and gas burned. We saw that during the fall of demand because of the lockdowns, the reduction in production came from less fossil fuels.

The problem is that people don't understand  the marginal production of electricity. Yes, in a country where 50% the electricity is produced by renowables, when you turn on a new mining rig, the spike of additional electricity demand comes almost entirely from fossil fuels.

Why? because the renewable energy plants already are producing all the electricity they can, no matter the actual demand. If they produce too much, they export it or store it using pumping stations. Therefore, any additional demand requires of turning on a coal or gas power plant in your region/country or in other country/region that is importing less net electricity. 

Yes, the bitcoin miners leave Sichuan (China), they wont produce less hydroelectric power, but they will export more electricity in other regions of China, which then will burn less coal. 

The only exception is if you are mining from an electrically isolated country like Iceland, or if you are installing solar panels to mine (you would still burn fossil fuels during the night). But these cases are an exception. And in the very long term, maybe more renewable plants would be built for satisfying this demand, but the opposite is happening, its delaying the closure of fossil fuel plants.

I’ve been working hard on my latest absolutely-correct analysis, and thought I’d share my analysis with you before I drop it on on shocked-face thumbnail YouTube channel.

We all know that for the last few months we’ve been jerked around between the vanilla trend line of the traditional rainbow graph and the the high end of the 200-day variable moving distributor. Enough already!

With Bitcoin now moving into an ascending octagon pattern, currently testing 48k  to the lower Neapolitan Trend Line of 39k, we’re at a key moment for the coin. If the trend line isn’t held, look for Bitcoin to range back downwards to 30k, even testing the mid-20k range. 

If we *do* hold the Neapolitan line, we could rocket past the 48k mark and overcome the asymmetric volatility, just like we saw at the end of last year’s oscillating quadrant phase. 

So is Bitcoin going up or down?

Well, I’ll give it to you straight: it’s quickly approaching Truth Time™️ for the 2021 bull market. If we can’t hold the 200-day Neopolitan line, I see a re-test of the 21-week directional level we’ve been testing for weeks. But if we *can* hold the Neopolitan line, and if Bitcoin blasts through the  27-week Lemon support metric, we will put this rocky road behind us. Then, the upward pressure could lead to a final crossing of the penultimate stochastic indicatior. 

That’s happened only once before, and everyone in this sub knows *precisely* what happened next. Invest accordingly.

 \- **Whoppercoin** \- Only in Russia can you find a cryptocurrency only for buying Burger King Whoppers. Last year, Burger King Russia announced the Whoppercoin initiative...basically a blockchain-based rewards program. Customers rack up one Whoppercoin for each ruble they spend, and those who accrue 1,700 Whoppercoins get a free burger. What a great deal! 

 \- **PotCoin** \- PotCoin provides blockchain payment technology and ecosystem solutions to empower the Cannabis Industry. PotCoin was released into the world towards the end of January 2014. From the very beginning, the developers (*three guys from Canada*) had made their message clear - they released the coin at **4:20 PM** (*420 is a symbolic number for marijuana*). Right from the start, they intended to become **the main currency of use when it comes to legal cannabis**. Whether it was their sense of humor, or the enthusiastic people taking charge, but PotCoin reached mainstream attention not long after its initial launch - *a couple of TV and online news stations helped spread the rumor about this new cryptocurrency...and than it crushed...like totally. Looks like it’s still possible to buy it, but it’s miles away from it’s previous glory.*

* 50g of ICO
* pinch of shitcoins
* and two tablespoons of melted crypto celebrity Tweets (just don't use Elon's, those are stale)

* mix everything in a large crypto exchange until homogenous or move to a hardware wallet
* set the oven to All-Time-High degrees Celcius
* place the mixture on a baking sheet
* ~~bake~~ HOLD for five years, just don't open the oven for five years or it will collapse like soufflé if you are not careful

3829,CryptoCurrency,Nervous_Sky_5167,"**ABTRACT (TL;DR)** 

The Pandemic has put many countries, including the United States, into economic turmoil. To stay afloat the rapids of the stacking debt from COVID-19, healthcare and reduced GDP productivity, many of these countries have resorted to heavy money-printing. However, due to the Pandemic's stay-at-home and reduced economical 'exchange' profile, cash isn't flowing around fast enough. This loss in monetary velocity nullifies and backs up the ongoing inflations' effect, and just like a dam filling up with water, it will burst very, very soon. The resulting aftermath of pent up inflation will severely damage both fiat value and trust. Although speculative, crypto among other assets will be quick to lap up the demand.   


**ELI5 ABTRACT (TL;DR)**

The Pandemic forced Fed to print crazy amounts of money. Since Pandemic also reduced money exchange rate, this reduced 'monetary velocity' is holding back a huge inflation wave. The aftermath will cause fiat to go down, and the resulting power gap could benefit assets like crypto. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Economics Reasoning: Significant Money Printing**

Between February and December of 2020, nearly 35% of all US dollars in existence were printed. (Choros, 2020) (Fig. 1).

&amp;#x200B;

[ Fig. 1, a graph tracking the circulating dollars printed by the US Feds. Notice the massive spike in printing as the Pandemic rolled around in early 2020 \(Source: FRED Economic Data, 2021b, as cited in Choros, 2020\). ](https://preview.redd.it/dbxy5bixt2o71.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=441e43ef0d4792de675de96410a6dd5034866792)

 

**Economics Reasoning: Low Monetary Velocity**

Since the Pandemic had started, stay-at-home orders combined with the lack of foreign money exchange (i.e. tourism) and lack of purchasing due to COVID-19 has caused a dramatic reduction in US money velocity, which is the speed at which money exchanges hands. Shown in Fig. 2, the velocity has dipped quite a bit, which 'localizes' the effects of the increased inflation caused by 2020's economic impact. If less hands exchange the newly printed dollars, the less widespread the overall effect will be. This is why *for now*, consumer goods' prices for example haven't jumped 35%, although there is still minor impact.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Fig. 2, a graph tracking the monetary velocity of the US dollar \(Source: FRED Economic Data, 2021a\). ](https://preview.redd.it/yxqouvezt2o71.png?width=1163&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2252ff6ae0eea1aef03683119d783431744bb709)

 However, as vaccinations go up and COVID-19 cases go down, more and more businesses are eager to open their doors, and well as shoppers and tourists ready to travel around and purchase things. This will release the dam previously holding back the aforementioned 35%+ cash printed inflation in *2020 alone*, because as more hands circulate the money, will inflation have the chance to distribute over the wider population.   


&amp;#x200B;

**THE AFTERMATH**

We cannot predict how bad the effects will be, but only estimate the damages. Both trust and value in fiat will diminish substantially, providing more room and popularity needed to grow cryptocurrencies for example, as an industry. I'll give it up to your imagination to what this would mean for your portfolio.

Of course, especially small businesses and those unfortunate on the socioeconomic scale will suffer the most, and there isn't much we can do to stop it, sadly.

The feds aren't working diligently on a matter that involves global economy. There have since been only *considerations* put into this problem. To quote Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, ""inflation, though elevated, will likely be moderate"". Compare that to the numbers I just showed you, c'mon, really?

&amp;#x200B;

**TO CONCLUDE**

This is something serious to consider as you invest in both cryptocurrencies and other assets like real estate and stocks. Please do your due diligence before considering any financial moves, especially under this situational umbrella. Inflation is usually something to consider in market trends, but under especially unique circumstances, should it be regarded with the upmost care.

Cheers to that bombshell! :)

* I understand that it's bad practice to keep your coins in an exchange's app, like Coinbase. For example, one should keep their ALGO in the ALGO wallet app. If you'd like to sell at some point, wouldn't you have to transfer the ALGO back to the exchange, like Coinbase or Kraken, and then sell? All selling must be through an exchange, right (except direct from one user to another)?
* Following that, if you keep your coins in a wallet, don't you have to pay gas fees each time you transfer them to an exchange?
* Is there a wallet that allows you to interact directly with an exchange?

At what point will people wake up and realize Cardano is basically useless? I highly advise people to invest in a real, proven coin like Etherium with actual use cases.

I know that they get paid to promote different clothing items, merch, etc.. but imagine if they knew about rewards just for upvotes, it’s like getting double paid.
I wonder, if these types of rewards go mainstream if it will bring more attention to these other platforms to adopt the same techniques as Reddit did with these Crypto rewards and distributions. 
I know some Boomers, like my mom, that is obsessed with Facebook and gets hundreds on likes or reactions on her posts but isn’t really getting anything from it other than satisfaction.

BAT - Love the concept, rewarding users for viewing ads and allowing users to directly tip their favorite sites. Could have a future, but has not really gathered much steam.


BTC - Shocking I know, but I've never owned BTC. This would probably be the safest bet.

I’ve been thinking on which is best to move forward to continue buying coins on. CB was where i started my crypto journey - ETH, which is now fully staked. Some other projects as well. After seeing money go away each buy (yes.. i know of CB Pro but still cannot buy things I want) I’ve moved to Voyager/Kraken. Which have been great to me, but still do not have projects I want to buy into. 

I’ve never bought yet from a DEFI platform yet; truthfully, I’m not sure how to. It’s more or less the complexity of trying to figure out to do so as well as the transfer fees. If I’m just DCA’ing.. it’ll cost a bit for my transfers and not sure if it’s worth it (I also know each cling has its own transfer fees. But does it offset purchases from other exchanges?)

Or am I just being a little bitch and need to sack up to buy on DEFI. I’m heavily invested already but want to continue to grow my portfolio correctly and especially with the flexibility of buying into projects/coins I truly believe in.","Better to buy on an exchange such as CB, Kraken, etc..

This is only one paragraph translated from german. This essay got me into cryptocurrency and on top of that i got a good grade on it. Writting everything was a blast!

The anonymous author with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper called ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" in November 2008. The publication laid the foundation for today's blockchain technology. To this day, it is unclear whether Satoshi Nakamoto is an individual or a group. The true identity is unknown despite investigations by a large number of journalists and cryptography experts. 

Bitcoin as a decentralized system as well as the possibility of anonymous and encrypted transactions are based on the ideology of the Cypherpunk movement in the 1990s. In summary, participants in the movement advocate the uncompromising protection of privacy and anonymity. The main goal is to offer a decentralized, digital payment system as an alternative during the economic crisis in 2008. 

The idea of a decentralized payment system is by no means new. However, a secure and robust system succeeds for the first time based on the blockchain technology used in BTC. The technology is open source and is available to anyone for further development and use for their own projects. 

Bitcoin is now the most popular cryptocurrency that can be bought, exchanged or sold internationally without the influence of third parties. Our society has not dealt with an alternative of banks until the release of Bitcoin. BTC now provides the impetus to question and critically assess the entire banking system. 

The cryptocurrency has received strong attention and popularity in the media. The reasons for this are the high volatility and the enormous price increase. Digital currencies such as bitcoin are stored in electronic wallets. The choice of wallet should be made depending on the intended use and area of application. Examples of wallets are hardware, mobile and desktop wallets.

3894,CryptoCurrency,bonnerforrest,"I will buy $5 of currency YOU choose

Hey everybody and happy fun friday. I'm feeling extra bullish today with the market and am looking for some random suggestions from people who are NOT financial advisors

I will buy $5 of any coin that the top10 comments people suggest. Whatever is available for trade on kraken, coin base, or [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) are all accepted. I'm looking to diversify with some coins I don't know anything about.  


I'm hoping the community can pull through for this and turn this $50 into $100 or more by the end of the weekend! just a fun little experiment I thought I'd try out. Even if its a shit coin, I will still buy it. I don have a plan on how long I will hold the assets, so go ahead and make some suggestions with your coin of choosing",Fun time,1631893002
3895,CryptoCurrency,crua9,"A while back I made this to help figure out if my grid bots were profitable or not. I added a tax thing onto it to know how much to hold back. You can adjust the numbers as needed and you also need to look up your local/federal taxes to know how much to put in. Note the green you should change the yellow don't touch.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cxb2jpo5my5JNBDyoA3ixU9Pu\_h1Upfh6Ge2LPTmhGA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cxb2jpo5my5JNBDyoA3ixU9Pu_h1Upfh6Ge2LPTmhGA/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why this is important for grid bot users is when you trade on places like Coinbase, Binance,  etc the trading fees is on the entire amount. Which means if your trading fee for the buy and sell = 7 cents and you only made 2 cents. Just on this alone you lost money. Or lets say the trading fees is 7 cents and your taxes is 50% and you only made 8 cents. You lost money. And I can keep going.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, the new version instead of playing guessing games since I can't figure out how to get the spreadsheet to figure out where the grids are by you just telling it the range and amount of grids. This focuses on 1 grid trade. Just use your highest 2 grids and then do it again for your lowest 2 grids. If it's profitable for the highest 2 and lowest 2, then in theory all the grids in the middle should be profitable. 

&amp;#x200B;

IMPORTANT: Anyone can in theory use this as a tool in normal trades. And in theory this should tell you how much to hold back for taxes if everything is setup right and depending on your country.",I updated the spreadsheet for the Trade and Tax Calculator,1631893029
