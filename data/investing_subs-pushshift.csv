7,investing,auser24,"Let's say the FED starts rising rates to contain inflation at some point in the future, which would hurt stocks. If this happens I want to have some exposure to asset classes that would benefit from an increase in rates. What would be the best options for this? Bonds are the first thing that comes to mind, but I can see some drawbacks, specially if we're talking about an inflationary scenario:

- Even with a rise in rates, nominal yields will likely stay below inflation on treasury bonds, yielding negative real returns. I don't see the FED rising rates to 3%+ anytime in the near future.
- I would have to hold the bond until maturity, selling it would be bad if rates keep rising because price is inversely correlated to yield. 

Are these assumptions correct? If so, are there better alternatives? TIPS does not sound like an alternative, its yield being bond yield minus inflation, so if bonds are below inflation so will TIPS (which is the current scenario, TIPS having negative yield). Gold price is inversely correlated to yields so it's a no-go. Crypto is high risk and I expect it would behave like so, with prices also falling, though it's hard to say. Are 1-2y bonds or CDs the best option here if I don't want to hold bonds for 10y?

27,investing,FearlessNL,"# Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional S.A. Analysis (Ticker: SID)

*An integrated steel company that is criminally undervalued*

# A general understanding of the business.

Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional is a Brazilian corporation incorporated in 1941. The Presidente Vargas Steelworks, located in the city of Volta Redonda, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, began its production of coke, pig iron and steel products in 1946, when they also incorporated the Casa de Pedra mine, located in the city of Congonhas, state of Minas Gerais, and the Arcos mine, located in the city of Arcos, state of Minas Gerais. The Casa de Pedra mine assures self-sufficiency in iron ore and the Arcos mine provides limestone and dolomite.

CSN was privatized through a series of auctions held in 1993 and early 1994, through which the Brazilian government sold its 91% ownership interest. The company began trading on the NYSE in 1997. It has a market cap of \~$6.1B with a share price of $4.46 at the time of writing.

*Current operations*

CSN is currently one of the largest integrated steel producers in Latin America in terms of crude steel production, they produced 11.3% of Brazil’s total crude steel production in 2020. They operate throughout the entire steel production chain, meaning they do everything from mining the ore to the sale of steel products. Their business can be separated in five segments: steel, mining, cement, logistics and energy.

*Steel*

CSN’s current annual crude steel capacity at their main facility is about 5.6 million tons. With an additional production capacity of 1.1 million tons of steel at their long steel segment in Germany. They obtain all their iron ore (and other products) from their own mines.

*Mining activities*

As previously mentioned, CSN obtains all their iron ore from their own mines. However, they sold 29.6 million tons, 34.9 million tons and 26.9 million tons of iron ore to third parties in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Their mines are strategically located within Brazil’s “Iron Ore Quadrangle” within the state of Minas Gerais.

*Logistics*

CSN holds stakes in and operates many business that operate in transportation of goods. They operate a port terminal for containers, called TECON. They also have participation in 3 railways.

*Cement*

CSN entered the cement industry in 2009 to take advantage of the synergy potential with their steelmaking business. They have gradually invested in their cement segment, with the most recent being the acquisition of the Brazilian business of LafargeHolcim for $1 billion. They also acquired Elizabeth Cimentos for a value of $214 million in July of this year.

*Electricity*

Steelmaking requires significant amounts of electricity to power rolling mills, production lines, hot metal processing, coking plants, cryogenic plant and auxiliary units. They produce most of the electricity from a power-plant at their main facility which secures them about 235 MW of capacity. In addition, they secure on average 188 MW through various equity interests.

# Valuation &amp; Growth

CSN isn’t a fancy EV company with revenue growing 1000% YOY, however they are growing fast compared to peers. Their earnings per share (EPS) has grown at an annual 38.3% over the past 5 years. They are also investing profits back into their own business through acquisitions. The insiders of this company are focused on growing the company considering they have a 54.5% stake.

Some statistics about the valuation of CSN:

P/E: 2.26  
P/Free Cash Flow: 2.68  
PEG: 0.58  
Return On Equity: 117.7%  
Return On Assets: 22.3%  
Return On Investment: 11.1%

This company has a price to free cash flow of 2.68. Which means with no growth at all it will have made its own market cap in profits in a little more than 2,5 years. They are also investing back heavily into their own business.

The average company in the steel-making industry has a P/E of 5.88, even though this isn’t a full-on steel company it is still noteworthy that it is trading at a P/E that is nearly 3 times lower than their main industry average. If we would value CSN at a P/E of 5.88 we would obtain a price of $11.88 indicating an increase of over 166%.

The estimated CAGR of the steel industry in the next 5 years is 4%, if we do a simple DCF analysis, with the assumptions of 4% growth over the next 5 years and a 2% growth rate in the years after, we get a fair enterprise value of $22.9B, compared to the current EV of $8.48B. This would also indicate a share price of around $12.00 (specifically $12.04).

The stock of CSN ($SID) has been more than cut in half in the recent months. This creates a wonderful buying opportunity for investors looking for value and growth. If you are interested in this company I would encourage you to read the 20-F (10-K for foreign companies) for yourself and decide if this is a good investment. After all I am just an individual and not a hedge fund, have fun investing!

52,investing,somalley3,"22 (m) working in finance, i currently split rent in a one bedroom with serious girl friend, and i’ve spent some time reflecting recently on how inclined i am to actually buy a house in the intermediate term. I’m less looking for advice on personal finance because i know there are better subreddits on that, but I wanted to raise conversation and see others’ insights on using a single family house as a practical vehicle for growing wealth in house equity. I’m familiar with the pros and cons of renting vs owning a home and i’ve read Rich Dad Poor Dad so no need to remind me that a home for many is actually a liability, i’m more thinking about let’s say the next 5-7 years whether it makes more sense to rent over an extended period of time and plow more money into equities or to build equity in a home by getting a mortgage. I know there’s lots of nuances to this and i consider myself to be a knowledgeable and reasonably sophisticated investor (at least with my own money) so i don’t need tips on how to allocate the difference necessarily, but the crux of my question boils down to over an intermediate 5-7 ish year time frame whether it’s more effective to build wealth generally in a diversified equities portfolio with increased marginal contributions rather than saving up for a downpayment on a house while continuing to rent, or save up for a down payment and use leverage from a mortgage to build real estate equity. Note, not looking for a house to ‘settle down’ in long term because i recognize the right house for a family has qualitative values not measurable or relevant to an investment analysis. Speaking purely from an investment stand point, i’m wondering whether a leveraged real estate investment (which is how i would think of a house if i bought one now) and all the costs associated as well as the equity in a booming real estate market compares with expected equity returns in medium term. part of my concern here is that neither stocks nor housing seem cheap, especially not in my area right now, but buying a house requires using leverage to enter a record hot asset class while continuing to rent and pouring more into stocks (in roth accounts and then taxable) feels like a more moderate decision.

106,investing,10xwannabe,"I wanted to throw this out there as a quick example mostly for our younger investors who may not appreciate in relation to time how money compounds in real life (hint doesn't feel like a straight line).

Here is an example of a situation a real life investor might experience:

If you take a 30 year old and he/ she starts to invest $1500/ month (18k/ year) for 30 years (until age 60) at a imaginary 8% return per year he/she will end up with 2+ MILLION.  

That is the type of example everyone has seen, but here is what most fail to appreciate which makes investing hard for many folks even with the best intentions...

1/2 of that return (1 MILLION) was gained only in the last 7-8 years of that 30 year period.  So even if the investor was diligent and did what he/ she was supposed to do they would have felt like they weren't making any progress, i.e. spinning the wheels for the first 22 years or so!  In fact, waiting for high growth at the end is NORMAL.  Folks get bummed out they aren't millionaires after about 1, 3, 5, even 10 years, but the above person ended up with 50% of all their future money to spend in the last 8 years or so (age 52-60 in this example).

Just an observation that may help others.  The point being once  you have an set asset allocation your job is just to be a robot and save EACH month over and over again and don't worry about the total $$$ in your accounts.  The latter you won't appreciate until the end of the journey (20+ years later from when you started).

Hey all, 

first off as a disclaimer there are never any guarantees with things like this. It may well turn out to be a Ponzi scheme and there are always risks which is why you should always take profit along the way and never spend more then what you can afford to lose. In saying that however I have personally made money out of this and short term (over the next year or so), I think this is a great little passive income earner. 

The site is called Upistic. You deposit crypto and it is locked in for a 20 day period. The deposited amounts are then used by Upistic’s own traders to trade Defi tokens in currency exchanges providing daily profits back to the initial investors (you). Depending how the traders perform each day you are guaranteed 1.3 - 2.3 percent daily on your investment to which you can watch generate in real time. You are also able to withdraw your profits daily or you also have the option to reinvest and compound to make increase profits. 

Like I said earlier this may sound too good to be true long term however short term, this is a great little money maker which many people are currently invested into.

&gt;We find that positive excess (strong) analyst coverage is associated with overvaluation and low future returns. This finding is consistent with the view that excessive analyst coverage, driven by investment banking incentives and analyst self-interests, raises investor optimism causing share prices to trade above fundamental value. However, weak analyst coverage causes stocks to trade below fundamental values. This finding indicates that investors tend to believe that these firms are more likely to be plagued by information asymmetries and agency problems. The results remain robust after controlling for the possible endogenous nature of analyst coverage and analysts' self-selection bias.

The opportunity here is to capitalize on the limited amount of IPv4 addresses in open circulation. The risk is that IPv6 adoption will occur sufficiently prior to any price increase and will result in loss of demand in IPv4.  Put differently, this is a bet that companies which are unwilling, or unable, to fully adopt IPv6 will pay a significant premium to continue doing business using their current tech.  


The price of IPv4 addresses has risen from \~$8/ea in 2014 to $50/ea in 2021 ([1.](https://i.imgur.com/EqW5jKn.png))  


* One concern here is that price growth was flat in 2019 before it started growing sharply in 2020. This might be indicative of a short-term bubble due to unexpected increase demand in remote needs.
* This is a relatively high-volume market. There are tens of millions in transactions occurring weekly. ([2.](https://i.imgur.com/nbMvpKZ.png))
* You must hold purchases for two years before they are able to be resold. ([3.](https://ipv4marketgroup.com/arin34/))

IPv6 adoption has grown from 3% to 38% from 2014 to 2021. [(4.)](https://i.imgur.com/ItptmoP.png)  


* Adoption growth is linear and *slowing* \- adoption has not quickened in response to the IPv4 price hike.
* Adoption has been far slower than anticipated. ""On 7 March 2013, the Internet Engineering Task Force created a working group for IPv4 sunset ... in May 2018 this working group was closed as no immediate work could be identified due to the slow transition to IPv6."" ([5.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_deployment#Coexistence_with_IPv4))  


I think this is a good play for me personally because:  


* I work in tech and feel I understand the needs of tech decently well.
* I am looking for a 'collectible' asset for part of my portfolio. I see IPv4 addresses as something similar to investing in M:TG cards, for example. I want to hold slightly less cash without investing more into stocks or cryptocurrency.
* I do not have any reservations about holding for half a decade. This is a small amount of money (\~5% of portfolio) and have absolutely no intent of selling within two years.

I'm taking a minority view here on Facebook, and believe it'll breakout after earnings, in spite of;

1. regulatory pressures from Congress
2. SNAP's harbinger of advertising headwinds
3. Stock prices dropping after each of the last three ER's.

However, to hedge against IV crush if the price action goes bearish, I took a \*\*December Vertical Call Spread.\*\* 

(read further for rationale)===========

. The expected ER is $3.19, compared to last quarter's $3.61 actual.

. FB in their conference call had already mentioned Apple's algo

. While SNAP was greatly affected by AAPL and thus dropped a quarter of it's price, FB is far bigger and has multiple revenue streams. The impact will be minimal, and think that it will surpass estimates, top and bottom.

. POC on the daily chart (from last ER until today), is at $341, which was in the range of yesterday's trade.

. Post-ER, I'm expecting it to reach above POC (as to how far up will depend on guidance).

. Whichever way price goes post-ER, expect the price to settle around POC level. Hence, a vertical debit spread for Dec, 330/335C was a safe bet to end in profit, with a max of 110%.

It says ‘betting’, however I believe it is an investment as there is no real ‘bet’ involved. Arbitrage betting is when two different bookmakers disagree on the odds of a two-way market (only two possible outcomes), therefore meaning if you bet on both sides of the market you will certainly make a small profit. An example will make things much easier:

SWEDEN VS KOSOVO - 9TH OCTOBER

MARKET - BOTH TEAMS TO SCORE

BET 1: MANSION BET (YES) ODDS - 2.45 (STAKE £125) (Potential return £306)

BET 2: BETVICTOR (NO) ODDS - 1.75 (STAKE £175) (Potential return £306)

1 bet will win the other will lose, but either way we will get back £306, when we only staked £300, this is a 2% ROI .

A 2% profit doesn’t seem like much in betting terms and is smirked at in betting communities but when you look at it as an investment it’s very exciting, I usually place arbs between 2-5%.

So why am I not a millionaire as this is essentially free money. This is the bad news; bookies don’t like it (it’s not illegal though) because they will certainly lose money over time. It’s easy to spot a foolish arbitrage bettor as they will bet on games in the Syrian 4th division etc. Therefore, there are many rules you must abide to arbitrage bet successfully. The main aim is to look like you are a punter, find arbs that are in high volume markets (top European football leagues), bet round numbers (not £97.65 etc) and at normal betting times. Eventually they will catch on to you and limit/close your betting accounts, but you can easily make a couple of thousand before then. Another difficulty is finding the arbitrage opportunities in ‘normal’ markets, as you might expect the more popular betting markets are the more efficient market odds, however there are some great tools and websites that can help.",Explaining the concept behind sports arbitrage and why it is an investment and not gambling,1634848694

I have a number of other stocks i trade or hold but these are a handful of the companies I really believe in longterm with the exception of maybe snapchat. I just had to note that one due to the 22% sell-off we are seeing after hours...

Netflix - reported solid numbers overall with eps coming in at 3.19, an 83% increase over the same period last year...they brought in 7.48 Bil in revenue and 1.45 Bil in net profits. They added 4.38 million new paid subscribers and expect that number to double next quarter, bringing the total count to 213.6 million. I believe the price action to the upside is justified and will continue. 

Tesla - best quarter yet for the ev car maker ! 13.76 Bil in revenue and 1.6 Bil in net profits. Gross profit margin increased to 26.6%. They delivered 241,300 vehicles and total production came in at 237,823. Numbers looking good and the price action/sentiment is very strong. Arkk base case for tesla shares is steep but starting to sound like a very possible reality. if the stock breaks above the previous all-time-highs of 900.40 we should see a decent move to the upside. I'm thinking 1k could come quick. 

SNAP - down 22% after hours on a fairly decent Q3 report...fwd p/e is a little high so it doesn't surprise me. Investors want a big beat on these growth companies sometimes and push the price down hard if eps doesn't come in much higher than expectations 

Shopify - earnings coming up next week on October 8th along with Amazon...growth is not appearing to slow up in 2021. Looks to me like they started ballooning as a company at the perfect time. They were well positioned to take advantage of the lock downs and have managed to maintain strong sales moving forward as things begin to open back up to some degree. I do not believe a full reopening of the economy would hurt the company at all. In fact it would likely be a driving factor for more growth and would help them sure up their position in the e-commerce sector. Nothing to report here yet for Q3 but i will be waiting patiently.

404,investing,Wisser95,"**Long Electronic Arts ($EA)**

Electronic Arts develops and sells video games. IP includes games such as Battlefield, The Sims, and FIFA.

A substantial portion of EA’s revenue is generated from *Ultimate Team* in EA’s sports games. Based on last FY, *Ultimate Team* brings in $1.62b or 29% of EA’s total revenue. In *Ultimate Team* gamers can collect digital player cards and build their own personalised team. Buying digital loot boxes with real money is a way to speed up that process.

On June 18th, EA [introduced](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/fifa/fifa-21/news/pitch-notes-fifa21-preview-packs) *Preview Packs* to *Ultimate Team*. These new type of loot boxes lets the player see what’s inside the loot box before buying. My thesis is that these new loot boxes are underappreciated by EA’s investors. The general idea here is that opening one of those loot boxes is like playing the casino, and EA is drawing more players into the casino by now handing out a free first round of loot boxes every day. To see why this works, just imagine what would happen with Philip Morris if it was able to hand every single human a couple of free cigarette puffs every single day!

The introduction of *Preview Packs* is seen by [some](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-06-18-ea-adds-ultimate-team-loot-boxes-that-let-you-see-all-items-before-you-buy-in-most-significant-shakeup-of-fifa-series-in-years) as EA’s response to the increasing pressure from governments about the link between loot boxes and (underage) gambling. My firm opinion is that *Preview Packs* will generate more, and not less, revenue for EA.

The beauty of all of this is that the additional revenue from *Preview Packs* translates almost fully into bottom-line profit. Distributing one additional DIGITAL loot box comes with almost zero additional costs for EA. Revenue = profit. *Preview Packs* will thus lead to a significant boost in EBIT. To put it all in perspective, EA’s last FY revenue was $5.63b of which $1.62b *Ultimate Team* revenue, and EBIT is $1.05b. Let’s conservatively assume that *Preview Packs* leads to a 10% boost in *Ultimate Team* revenue. That’s $162m. Add that to EBIT and EBIT grows by 15.5%. That’s some nice operating leverage.

About timing. *Preview Packs* were temporarily available during the EURO2020 tournament for \~6 wks following June 18th. In earnings call 1Q2021 (qtr ending June 30rd), EA indicated that preview packs were successful and that they’ve seen increased engagement and higher rate of conversion. *Preview Packs* were then made available on a permanent basis with the launch of FIFA22 on October 1st. Because of *Preview Packs*, I expect *Ultimate Team* revenue will break records and market expectations. I expect to remain long for at least 3 months, waiting for 3Q2021 earnings (qtr ending December 31st) that should demonstrate the profitability of *Preview Packs* to EA’s investors.

I share my comments regarding the portfolio of Ray Dalio - All seasons:

&amp;#x200B;

* **VTI - 30.00%** \- I find it adequate for the portfolio profile
* **TLT - 40.00%** \- With an increase in rates in the next few years, this could be a weak point of the portfolio as it is long-term bonds +10 years.
* **IEF - 15.00%** \- They also have sensitivity to rate increases, although it is shorter term, so it would be more tolerable.
* **DBC - 7.50%** \- I do not like commodities personally, although I understand in this portfolio the objective is to look for uncorrelated assets
* **GLD - 7.50%** \- I do not like gold personally, although I understand in this portfolio the objective is to look for uncorrelated assets

Historical:

Performance from 2013 to 2021: 7.90% YoY / Standard Dev 6.51% / Worst Year -3.25%

&amp;#x200B;

**Updated Portfolio**

So considering the above, I gave myself the task of trying to adapt the previous portfolio to reduce the possible ""risks"" that I see, with few changes, resulting in the following:

&amp;#x200B;

* **VTI - 30.00%** \- Same
* **TLT - 20.00%** \- It is reduced to 20% to reduce the risk of an increase in rates
* **IEF - 15.00%** \- Same
* **DBC - 7.50% to XLU** \- It is eliminated from the portfolio and replaced with ""utilities"" (ETF XLU), since it is an asset that has a similar correlation to commodities but a superior performance
* **GLD - 7.50%** \- Same
* **BNDX - 20%** \- International bonds from developed countries are added, which reduce the risk of TLT.

442,investing,ithinktherefore88,"Hello there! I'm trying to wrap my head around bond fund pricing during rising rates.

Lets say rates rise. Bond funds drop in price because people are selling their older bonds with lower interest rates. Because of this the bond fund pays a higher % dividend relative to share price. 

Now, does the fund pay more interest because the fund sold the old bonds and bought new ones with higher interest? Or is it just the market pricing in the fund with the fund owning the same lower yield bonds? 

And finally, as the lower yield bonds mature in the fund, and higher yield bonds are bought, does that mean the bond fund price will rise, since the total yield relative to price of the fund grows, as old bonds mature? 

Basically, I'm trying to figure out if bond funds only take temporary hits from rising rates and eventually recover in principal price.

463,investing,Vivid-Firefighter982,"This post is a summary of comments on threads and blog posts comparing traditional IRAs to Roths. In particular, I wanted to comment on and offer some arguments against 5 major points that find their way into many of the comparison threads.

**1st sentiment to dispute: low income earners who expect to make more later should do Roths, high income earners who expect to make less later should do traditional.**

I have seen this point a few times:

&gt;If you’re in a high bracket and expect little or no income in retirement take traditional. Otherwise if you’re in a low bracket now and expect more income in retirement take Roth. Or just do both.

This is how I used to think and on the surface, it is an accurate statement. I myself am currently in a high earning tax bracket, and have favored traditional IRAs historically assuming that I'll be making less in retirement. And that is true, I will have more available cash at the current time and will be paying a lower effective tax rate at the time of withdrawal.

There's one major problem: while it is true that for high income earners using a Roth you are paying a higher current tax rate, *you are paying a 0% tax rate on your gains.* This 0% tax on capital gains usually outweighs the taxes saved at time of deposit with a traditional IRA. What's even worse is that this money is taxed as ordinary income instead of as capital gains.

\-

**2nd point to dispute: the investment accounts work out to be the same over time.**

This leads me to the next sleight-of-hand that a lot of traditional IRA advocates try to pull. Take a look at [this Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kZ7Qnwh1lsi87to4LpgBbVHDb3iJ7nH1-7pONCzU3yo/edit) that calculates gains for traditional vs Roth.

Now it's tempting to look at these numbers and think ""Oh see, there you go. It doesn't matter, you end up with the same money either way."" But look at the assumptions this sheet is making: Instead of having you max out your Roth, it assumes that the 5k you were going to put into your traditional IRA is reduced to 3.5k with your Roth. This is not what happens and is such a dramatic error that I think it's intentional -- who doesn't max out their Roth if they can? You're not depositing less, you're depositing the maximum and paying more in taxes (ie. losing available cash). Then, you make the same gains but with a Roth they're not taxed.

Using the scenario in the linked Excel chart we can more accurately reflect what happens for most people: you have $1250 of extra available cash each year with a traditional. 1250 x 12 = $15k over 12 years that you would have had at the cost of of $18.3k of additional taxes at retirement (with a Roth paying 37% taxes now vs with a traditional IRA paying 22% at retirement).

If you want to do the numbers again, here is another example taken from a comment comparing IRAs to Roths with the following math:

&gt;assuming 30% tax  
&gt;  
&gt;10,000 = 7,000 after tax going into roth = $122,145.82 after 30years @ 10%  
&gt;  
&gt;10,000 full going into trad/401k = $174,494 after 30years @ 10% = $122,145.82 after paying 30% tax.

This is disingenuous. Remember, a Roth is not ""tax free"" but *post-tax*. The numbers evolve differently if you are maxing your IRA out.

* *Roth investment*: 15,900 = 10,000 after tax going into Roth at 37% tax rate = $175k after 30 years at 10% - $5,900 of less available cash at the time of deposit (with a higher tax rate and principal) + $54k gained (""tax free"" or post-tax gains) at the time of withdrawal = **$49.7k overall gains.**
* *Traditional investment*: 10,000 pre-tax going into traditional IRA with $5.9k more available cash at time of deposit, in exchange for 22% tax rate at retirement instead of 37% at time of deposit as would have occurred with a Roth = $175k after 30 years; 54k gained but taxed at 22% instead of 37% = **42k overall gains.** In most of the scenarios I calculated, Roths came out ahead in the long run.

So, taking into account the different expected tax rates, with a traditional IRA you are giving up 7k of long term gains for an additional 5.9k of available cash at the current time. What you do with this money determines its *opportunity cost*.

This is a stronger [retirement tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VZ4wKbUXdc8VA0mG4ri2wP9VuZCwae7b9MvA4u2HT7w/copy) developed by u/jeff_varszegi from [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/) if any of you are familiar. There are some aspects that caught my attention as needing refinement (discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/hhdvbrq/?context=3)), but my understanding is very basic and I could be missing something.

**3rd point to dispute: An anti-Roth post at Go Curry Cracker**

There is a well known anti-Roth post at Go Curry Cracker entitled ""The Great Roth Controversy"" (I can't link the url as it is not allowed in the subreddit). The amount of mental gymnastics that the post undergoes to make its points is staggering:

&gt;Dollars saved in a Traditional 401k / IRA are pre-tax.  We pay no income tax on dollars going in, an immediate savings of up to 39.6%, the highest marginal rate.  The invested funds are allowed to grow **tax free**, so all interest, dividends, and capital gains are untaxed until withdrawn from the account.  Upon withdrawal, all funds are treated as ordinary income, similar to a paycheck.

This is very inaccurate wording. The invested funds in an IRA don't grow ""tax free"". As said by the author themselves in the first sentence, they grow **pre-tax**. The invested funds in a Roth also don't grow ""tax free"" but **post-tax**. This is the major benefit of a Roth over traditional.

Then the post starts talking about theoretical scenarios where a family would be paying 40% taxes with a Roth but would be reduced to poverty level income in retirement -- the so called ""first and last dollar"" argument. This is incredibly misleading. Instead it should be a ""last and last dollar"" argument. What are you paying as far as a marginal tax rate on the Traditional vs the Roth -- ie. what would an individual have been making otherwise. You have to take into account other income streams to know your base income and effective/marginal tax rates.

Another point made in this blog is that the greater available cash with a traditional IRA can then be used to invest in an index fund anyways, functionally becoming a Roth at annual capital gains tax rates. First off, why wouldn't you want post-tax gains? The point they leave unspoken is you're paying a premium for more available cash at the current time with a traditional IRA. And that's assuming an individual invests this money -- the average person is actually just redistributing savings.

For high earners that will earn less at retirement, a Roth requires a higher initial investment, but with the benefit of greater long term cash gains. With a traditional IRA, on the other hand, you are functionally increasing *available cash* because you're paying the lower tax rate that will exist when you retire. This is at the expense of *post-tax gains*.

For low earners that expect to earn *more* at retirement than they are currently, a Roth will have a lower tax rate fixed at the time of deposit as well as the ""tax-free"" gains. This is a double-win scenario with a Roth. If they had invested in a traditional IRA, it would have been a double loss.

\-

**4th point to dispute: It's pointless to try to predict the future.**

Another argument I've heard is that tax rates are difficult to predict in the future. While researching this idea I came across the following charts:

I'm not a tax expert, but from these it appears fairly reasonable to guess that incremental tax brackets won't be changing dramatically in the next few decades. If I am understanding trends shown in the linked charts, if I'm in a higher income tax bracket at retirement, then I will be paying lower taxes than now and if I'm in a lower income tax bracket at retirement (which is more likely if I haven't developed passive income) I will be paying higher taxes than now.

The more important point, as shown in the math above, is that for the average person, *tax rates* matter less than *post-tax ('tax-free') gains.* That is to say: the amount you gain in a post-tax retirement account will usually be more than the amount you save by a lower effective tax rate in a pre-tax retirement account, even in a top tax bracket.

Of course this is not a guarantee. Your Roths could be invested poorly, there could be a revolution and the entire tax structure we've had for the last century could be changed to a universal standard tax rate, you could win the lottery, etc. but at some point we have to accept that we're dealing with probabilities. If you haven't developed a cumulatively progressive source of passive income *and* you're not in a defined hierarchy (ie. a partnership track in a law firm or medical group, a path to senior management at a large corporation, etc) or you sell a product that can be leveraged to economies of scale (ie. a brand-name app), you will probably be in an eat-what-you-kill situation at retirement and so be making less in retirement than you are in middle age.

\-

**5th point to dispute: That there are universal solutions. Remember:** ***one size fits all is a size that fits none.***

**A comment I've come across is that having both a traditional IRA and a Roth is good because you're ""diversifying"".** The reasoning behind this is that a traditional IRA will be counted as part of taxable income in retirement and a Roth can be used for additional tax-free withdrawals that would put one out of their desired tax bracket.

This doesn't make sense as a general rule and must be calculated for your individual circumstances. By my own personal math, for example, it is a bad idea for me to do a traditional IRA because the lower tax rate at retirement would not compensate for the tax-free gains of a Roth. This is an example of where something that sounds like good advice (ie. ""It's always good to diversify."") actually takes you down a less financially successful path.

Another point to keep in mind is that your year to year tax situation matters a great deal. Let's say you retire early, get laid off or have a year where you are transitioning jobs so your income is low. This is a great opportunity for a Roth IRA conversion ladder -- ie. moving your pre-tax (IRA/401k) money into to post tax (Roth) accounts. Use this year as an opportunity to pay the lower effective tax rate at deposit *and* get the benefits of post-tax gains. A double-whammy of tax gains.

Last quarter revenue without any sales was 1.1 million and EPS -0.07 . Revenue earned through 30 active Senhances .they are performing around 500 surgery per quarter. Company has a solid passive income. now if we assume each Senhance cost around 1.2 million and even if we don't count leasing contract from Japan, it means Q3 revenue should be more than 2.3 million. That means more than 100% than last quarter and i expect 25% or 50% better EPS than last quarter.  So in my eyes Asensus is shining as a good buy opportunity .

I have a close relationship with an old professor of mine who teaches investments at the college level, we often chat. He was a derivatives trader for 20 years back in the 80s and 90s.

He swears and insists that when rates begin to rise the market is going to absolutely eat shit, and most if not all valuations will drop. He says that the market has been hooked on the feds liquidity since ‘08 and the withdrawals will be severe. He has been slowly divesting the past few months.

By the same token, since it's a major blue chip stock and already has a massive market cap, I'm not really sure if it even makes sense to buy as a single stock or if I should just invest the money into index funds that would naturally have Disney holdings and might have higher annual returns...?

Roughly speaking - arbitrage is an investment opportunity/strategy that never loses money, but has an opportunity to make it. 

With that being said - I'd like to think about the following strategy. AMEX cards currently allow users to venmo money at no cost - e.g. one can use their AMEX card with venmo for no fee. In some sense, one can use this to get interest free margin (for a period until the credit card bill is due) - venmo a trusted friend or relative using an AMEX card, and have them venmo you back. Thus, I propose the following:

1. Use the above mechanism to get some money into your bank account. 
2. Move the money into ultra short duration bonds, or even more safely, a high-yield savings account, like those of Ally bank. The nice thing about the savings account is there's no need to transact on a secondary market, and zero probability of paying any transaction costs.
3. Collect the interest on the account, and pay back the AMEX bill. If you'd like, you can even compensate your trusted friend with a fraction of the interest, or you two can be counterparties for each other in this scheme!

This can even be automated with automatic payments to AMEX from the savings account in question - the only thing that cannot be automated is the venmo to and from your counterparty.

That being said - is there any reason this is not a feasible strategy? The only risks I can see are 

1. opportunity cost - the profit from such a strategy is on the order of cents or single dollars per month. You might as well use your time to do something actualy useful :)
2. Mismatching cash flows so that you miss a credit card payment and get hit with interest (which will probably wipe out your profits lol), but if setup properly this should never happen.",AMEX Venmo Arbitrage - Thoughts?,1634590610

Flooding in the coal hub of Shanxi province have driven prices up to $234 a metric ton as the government tries to kickstart extra production, further measures are needed to prevent more generators cutting off their turbines and causing blackouts through northern China’s winter. That means a crackdown on the factories that still consume the majority of electricity.  Industry makes up 25% of grid demand in the U.S., in China it’s 59%  — more than all the country’s homes, offices and retail stores put together. Cheap power has been essential for development in China. The problem now is that coal is very expensive. That’s where renewables come in. At the same time that price curbs are being removed from industries, capacity curbs are being lifted from zero-carbon power generation.

Case for Short-Squeeze

1. Prog has one of the highest SI (about 64%) while only one entity is trying to keep the price suppressed (Athyrium).

2. CTB continues to rise everyday as per Ortex data

3. Ortex has issued all 3 signals of short-squeeze on Prog

4. It’s a penny stock at a price that anyone who is in stock market investing can easily buy and hold to add to buying pressure.

5. Price jump from 0.88 to 2.5 brought in a lot of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 calls option ITM for 10/15

6. The company shorting it doesn’t have unlimited money supply to keep the price suppressed unlike a hedgefund that can/does divert all their money to control any stock they want.

7. **Catalysts:** Prog already got a patient approved October 5th but no PR because of the Athyium manipulation below (personal opinion).

a. **Evidence (**[**Look at the date of recent patent**](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/progenity-inc)**)**

8. **No unlimited money for Athyrium to short:** Athyrium isn’t in core business of shorting to make money and continue to do until they win. This factor alone along with buying pressure will force them to wave white flag within days-not weeks.

**Why Athyrium is shorting is and is in trouble now.**

1. Athyrium has a pattern of suppressing price to buy low as many shares as they can to take control of the company and then sell at a premium ([Evidence](https://www.athyrium.com/case-study-verenium.php))

2. However, this time around Athyrium gets caught with Prog where retail picked this stock and brought into light of short-squeeze play.

3. Shorting means that this insider has to cover its short position eventually and they don’t have enough time and only hope is more share issue which is not happening until November 20th and actually may not even happen if squeeze happens before end of October. 

4. They hoped that retail eye won’t catch prog and hence they can cover  lower when the time comes

5. **Evidence of Athyrium manipulation: (**[**https://www.athyrium.com/case-study-verenium.php**](https://www.athyrium.com/case-study-verenium.php)**).** This article clearly shows that Athyrium is not new to this and was able to do this before, only difference is that Prog got retail attention making it difficult to manipulate easily. 

**a.** **Barcoding:**  The price is experiencing barcoding last whole week where it moves by 10 cents and then whole day is a move of max 4-5 cents each day. This is their tactic to continue buying lower to accumulate and hope retail pressure doesn’t come in.

**b.** **Way to break barcoding:**  With enough volume in even 1 day, tables will be turned and any price above $2.5 in coming week gives majority control to retail to make squeeze happen.

**Scenario 1 of Short Squeeze.**

**1.** With enough volume (500 Mil to a billion), the play will be totally out of Athyrium’s hands because it can lead to a price range of $2.40-$3.25 hopefully this coming week.

**2.** This will force Athyrium to cover its position and trigger a gamma-squeeze effect prior to 10/15.

**Scenario 2 of Short Squeeze.**

**1.** Continuing with first scenario, the price will be in $5 and above range in following week of 10/15

**2.** Buyout option is still on the table which means Prog can never be sold under $5 and price decided for buyout is $8-$10 so every retail investor makes money while Athyrium goes home defeated with their lesser shares and whatever price.

**Scenario 3 of Short Squeeze.**

**1.** The buying pressure from scenario 3 continues leading the prog price in high double digits, leading to no share issue possibility at all and buyout still happens which means still atleastt 50%-70% premium on that price (Let’s say $25 + 50%-70%).

**Scenario 4 of Short Squeeze (Least desirable for retail investors).**

**1.** Athyirum continues to do its shit plan and keeps price down before buyout. They will cover at lower cost and everyone holding shares makes just good enough profit at $4 price buyout.

**How to make squeeze happen:**

1. Significant ITM calls buy volume for those who love option play.

2. One day of 300-500 Mil in volume with buying pressure to just start the squeeze this week

**P.S:** It is up by 64% which is still nothing in comparison to upward potential it has",$PROG Why it’s the easiest Short-squeeze with atleast high double-digit upward potential (Insider backstabbing by Athyrium)- Its still the highest shorted stock with a lot of catalysts happening,1634517259

Just recently state miner Codelco’s copper production for the month of August took a dip, going down by 6.7% year-on-year to 144,500 tonnes due to a strike in one of their mines. BHP, another big company, showed a drop in their copper production as well because their Escondida mine has issues in operation due to the imposed restriction caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Chile is the top producer in the world when it comes to copper, so the production getting affected is a big deal.

Another issue is also the problem with property giant China Evergrande Group. The company encountered a debt crisis that caused copper prices to fall, fueling worries about the demand for the metal. The price touched at $4.090 per pound ($8,998 per tonne) on the Comex market in New York. Though it seemed to have bounced back recently after they announced a deal over a $35.9 million bond interest payment.

Quahl is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of payment cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the quahl, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating quahls for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your quahls can be worth a lot.

(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said this year’s inflation surge is lasting longer than policymakers expected, so it’s not appropriate to refer to such price increases as transitory. 

“Transitory is a dirty word,” Bostic said in a virtual speech to the Peterson Institute for International Economics on Tuesday. He spoke with a glass jar labeled “transitory” at his side, depositing $1 each time he used the “swear word,” as it’s become known to him and his staff over the past few months. 

“It is becoming increasingly clear that the feature of this episode that has animated price pressures — mainly the intense and widespread supply-chain disruptions — will not be brief,” Bostic said. “By this definition, then, the forces are not transitory.”

Bostic, who votes on monetary policy this year, endorsed the Federal Open Market Committee’s plans to taper its $120 billion in monthly asset purchases, which is likely to start at its November meeting. In a Q&amp;A with Peterson President Adam Posen, Bostic said U.S. growth and the recovery in employment have exceeded his expectations.

“I’ve adjusted my ‘dot plot’ submissions to reflect much greater growth, much more in terms of jobs and also higher inflation,” Bostic said, referring to the committee’s quarterly interest rate forecasts. “It’s also called me to pull forward some of my thinking about when interest rate liftoff will be. That’s still more than a year off in my forecasts.”

Tapering is unlikely to slow the economy because markets are functioning well and the issues with the U.S. economy are more about supply-chain disruptions from Covid-19 rather than demand, he said in the Q&amp;A.

Bostic’s concern with inflation was echoed by St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said he favors starting to taper in November and finishing by the first quarter of 2022 to give the central bank flexibility to raise rates if necessary.

“The story that inflation will come down naturally is a reasonable one, but I only want to put 50% probability on that scenario,” Bullard said Tuesday in a televised interview with CNBC. “I have got to put some probability on a scenario where inflation stays high or even goes higher.”

In his prepared remarks, Bostic said he was seeing signs of a broadening in inflation.

“I believe evidence is mounting that price pressures have broadened beyond the handful of items most directly connected to supply-chain issues or the reopening of the services sector,” he said.

He said longer-run inflation expectations measures have climbed, with many reaching decade highs.

“These upside risks to the inflation outlook bear watching closely,” Bostic said. “Up to now, indicators do not suggest that long-run inflation expectations are dangerously untethered. But the episodic pressures could grind on long enough to unanchor expectations. We will be watching carefully.”

U.S. consumer prices matched a 30-year high in September with 5.4% year-over-year growth.

That makes sense. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the policy response of lockdowns and government stimulus, unleashed a massive switch in spending from services to goods. Spending on U.S. durable goods, in March, was 26% above its pre-pandemic trend.

“Suffice to say, a 26% excess demand for durable goods cannot be satisfied by a modern manufacturing sector that utilizes just-in-time supply chains and negligible spare capacity! As surging demand met relatively fixed supply, the price of durable goods skyrocketed to the current 11% above its pre-pandemic trend,” said Dhaval Joshi, chief strategist of BCA Research’s Counterpoint.

The surprise however has been the stickiness of services prices. That, Joshi explained, is because it wasn’t a classic demand shock. There was no point in services companies reducing prices because their customers couldn’t get those services anyway. “Meanwhile, statisticians continued to record the seemingly unaffected price of eating out or going to the theater, even though most restaurants and entertainment venues were shut,” he said.

There’s one notable country that didn’t mandate shutdowns or lockdowns — Sweden. And there, services prices did decline. And now, inflation in Sweden is about 3 percentage points less than in the U.S.

What the Swedish experience suggests is that prices will eventually stabilize. “The surging demand for durables is correcting. Since March, it is already down by 15% but requires a further 7% decline to reach its pre-pandemic trend, which we fully expect to happen. After all, there are only so many smartphones and used cars that you can own,” Joshi said.

As for services, there are two forces — the wage rises as a result of the rocketing price of goods, but the deflationary force of hybrid home and office working, which will make it difficult for services spending to reach its pre-pandemic trending.",Inflation remains transitory.

Infinera settled before going to trial, but the lawyers secured me an incentive award from the courts as part of the settlement, as compensation for being a lead plaintiff. I was honestly expecting to get like 15 bucks thrown my way if there was a settlement - over the years I've received several settlement awards, a few for $100 or $200 but the vast majority end up being &lt;$25, and I've never been lead plaintiff before and didn't have any idea what to expect - so I was completely surprised when **they sent me a $1,000 check!!** 

I can't stress enough how little effort was required on my part. I signed an agreement to let them represent me, sent them redacted PDF copy of my brokerage statement to confirm I owned the shares during the settlement period, and sent maybe 3 one-sentence emails over a period of about 3 months authorizing them to take each of steps they advised taking on my behalf.

Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) recently received an optimistic outlook from Jefferies Equity Research, with analyst Philippe Houchois raising his price target on the automaker from $850 to $950 per share. Jefferies cited several reasons behind its update on TSLA stock, though the analyst noted that part of it is due to the growing gap between Tesla and legacy OEMs. 

“We raise EBIT estimates 7-9% for 2022-23 and PT to $950 on higher capacity ramp and sustained demand, following further analysis of Q3 data and various sources of information on the soon-to-be-launched Berlin facility. For some time, the narrative has been legacy OEMs closing the gap; we see little evidence as Tesla continues to challenge at multiple levels.

1089,investing,OfficerCHODEMAN,"Hi guys, lucky for me, GWH came onto my radar two weeks ago when I was looking into the plans for Sun Cable, an Australian plan to provide up to 15% of Singapores daily electricity needs via massive solar farms and an undersea cable.

The main challenge with renewables at the moment is battery storage. Renewables are now the cheapest power source available but face massive constraints in the form of consistent supply and grid smoothing. Lithium ion mega storages are currently the answer but have many drawbacks. High fire risk, 4 hour max storage, fast degradation, high price, environmentally damaging disposal and need for cooling.

Enter ESS storage ($GWH) an iron flow battery made of Iron and electrolytes and salt water. Iron flow batteriy is a type of electrochemical cell where chemical energy is provided by two chemical components dissolved in liquids that are pumped through the system on separate sides of a membrane.\[2\]\[3\] Ion exchange (accompanied by flow of electric current) occurs through the membrane while both liquids circulate in their own respective space. (wikipedia)

ESS could be the future for renewable storage and billionaire backers like Bill Gates are all over the future tech ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/11/ess-battery-company-backed-by-bill-gates-softbank-opens-on-nyse.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/11/ess-battery-company-backed-by-bill-gates-softbank-opens-on-nyse.html)). It has a very reasonable 70% round trip efficiency, meaning it loses 30% of the power you put into it.

ESS has a few advantages over lithium ion; No need for cooling so can be used in hot environments like Texas, Australia, California. Extremely cheap source materials. Storage up to 10 hours. 20,000 cycle life and NO storage degradation versus 5000 cycle life for lithium ion.

The downside I can see for this stock are new battery techs stealing market share. Slow adoption of renewables. Or potentially extreme price drop in lithium ion cost, tech or safety.

I am long on this stock

Something curious I noticed this morning is GHW had a high short borrow fee (130%) whilst there are only 4.3 million shares available for public trading due to 180 day lockup([https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/q6c8gl/gwh\_ess\_tech\_backed\_by\_bill\_gates\_and\_me\_started/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/q6c8gl/gwh_ess_tech_backed_by_bill_gates_and_me_started/)). GWH has already squeezed once. The reason GWH squeezed initially is because a lot of people are shorting SPACs as they have fallen out of favour to investors recently AND GWH had a high redemption of shares (bailing out of the SPAC)

Some bondholders said they did not receive coupon payments totalling US$148 million on Evergrande's April 2022, April 2023 and April 2024 notes due by 0400 GMT on Tuesday, following two other payments it missed in September.

1163,investing,X-2357,"IONq is the first of many world changing quantum computer companies. Rigetti uses traditional superconducting quantum arrays that translate a little easier to conventional computers. The huge downside is the need for extreme cooling. Rigetti uses multi layers where the innermost layer is 100x colder than outerspace. Xanadu uses photonic systems that are great, and run at room temp but they need lots of additional hardware to work and will be difficult to scale down. Microsoft is working on topological arrays which would provide utility benefits but it hasn't been proven yet and they had to retract one of their papers on it. The point is that there are various methods to how you can create and manipulate qubits, the foundation for quantum computing.

IONq uses trapped ions, from a single atom of ytterbium. Technically a rare metal but it's not rare. Then they manipulate the ions using lasers to create the qubits on the array. Sh*t is bleeding edge and I understand .005% of it but I read everything I can find. It can run at room temp and be easily scaled. Basically IONq doesn't need all the extra resources to create and manipulate their qubits, so the cost and energy requirements are down. This also allows for upscaling arrays on existing hardware. Like they can turn a 16 qubit system into a 64 qubit system eventually using the same stuff  they just have to reduce the expected errors that come with quantum computing.

IONq got starting investment money from Amazon, Bill Gates, Samsung, Lockheed Martin, Hyundai, goldman sachs and more. They used that money to prove the tech works and are currently operating with Amazon Braket as their most powerful hardware supplier. Currently IONq has the most powerful quantum computer in business operation at 32 qubits. The next closest comp is 16 qubits. And you can have 9 qubit, 11 qubits computers, it doesn't need to be doubled evenly like ram for instance.

Remember when you see qubit numbers in the future and from other companies, what that really means.

Quantum computing is based on ""physical qubits"" and ""digital"" simulated qubits. Conventional computers use bits.

No matter what method you use, ions, photonic, superconducting, etc, You can't have a fully isolated qubit because then you couldn't interact with it to manipulate and tell it what to do. To get around this, modern quantum computing is based on running ""leaking"" environments with varying fidelity and trackable errors. We use the say 93% that is still functional to simulate more isolated qubits, and use those to simulate even more isolated qubits, in deeper layers until we have a fully isolated qubit we can error correct. 

Eventually we need 1 million qubit machines to simulate 10k error corrected machines. IONq just demonstrated how they can scale up to a million at a recent presentation. Eventually a QPU could really lead to some radically advancements in financial predictions, cybersecurity and encryption, biotech discovery, simulation modeling and on and on.

They SPAC merged with DMYI with $600m , $350m of which is pipe investment that is locked up for 6 months from now. Ran to $12 before merger, tanked to $10 at merger, tanked to $7.30 during spy correction and tech sell off. It was mostly shorts based on volume. They have tiny revenue because they are just getting started but that doesn't matter imo. They had that white house presentation to show off and IONq is the only pure quantum computer company on the market so far, with rigetti spac io'ing in a few months.

The pipe investment unlocks in 5 1/2 months and that could be the only negative event coming up. I'll decide what I do with my shares, closer to the date, either hold or sell then compound my gains to hold, maybe for life. It's bleeding edge tech and to try to simplify it more, instead of linear binary data, 1s and 0s. The data can be 1 and 0 at the same time in any ratio, in any direction. It's a bigger technological leap than people understand.

How I see it, the macro-environment is really stacked against crypto-mining stocks AFTER the current bull run is over. Bitcoin usually takes 1-2 years to decline to a new low (this time a good estimate is probably 75% from ATH); interest rates are likely to go up in the next 1-2 years making the debt these companies have more difficult to service; and most importantly, these stocks are momentum-driven, when investors realize the bull run is over I think many will not want to wait years to see new highs.

1213,investing,Minimum_Narwhal_3631,"I wanted to introduce you to a game that I have been playing for several months.

This is Rollercoin which is over 3 years old now. In fact, the game is all about virtually mining bitcoin, ethereum, or doge. But, although the game is virtual, you still earn bitcoins.

Basically, the idea is that every 5 minutes or so (depending on the hash powers), players receive the rewards for resolving a block in the blokchain. The rewards are even stronger than the miner at high power.

Yes, it works the same as bitcoin mining in “real life” (oh yeah). So it works as if you had to run a mining farm. That is, you will have to manage the electricity, your rigs, your installations etc.

To create Mining Power, you will need to play games. The more you play, the higher your power and therefore the more you win. It is by playing the various games in RollerCoin that you ""mine"" bitcoin (or etherum, doge). The more you play, the more you win.

You can also mine the site's crypto which is the rollertoken to buy miners. You can convert everything to rollertokens by the way. This token is not real but it intends to create an ecosystem with it. They also want to make an NFT system. The site is progressing quite quickly at the project level and it is starting to be nice.

I'm aware many despise AT&amp;T - this is an objective view - not saying buy/hold/sell, just want to discuss.

Current Share Price = $25.42 / Current Dividend = 8.81% / Annual Dividend = $2.08.

Projected dividend after the Warner bros/Disc deal = $1.11 per share annualized.

Projected yield after the merger at current price = 4.4%.

Assuming the following:

* 7.1 billion AT&amp;T shares on issue
* Value of Warner bros Discovery 120 bil (High), 100 bil (mid), 80 bil (low) and 60 bil (conservative)
* T shareholders get 70% of shares in new company
* Dividend after merger cut to $1.11 per share

With the following calculation:

(value of new company \* 70%) / 7.1 billion shares on issue = Value of new company per AT&amp;T share

So...

1. (120 billion \* 70%) / 7.1billion = $11.83 per share (High value)
2. (100 billion \* 70%) / 7.1billion = $9.85 per share (Mid value)
3. (80 billion \* 70%) / 7.1 billiion = $7.88 per share (Low value)
4. (60 billion \* 70%) / 7.1 billiion = $5.91 per share (Conservative value)

So... at the current valuation assuming no price change after merget

1. High value = $37.25 ($11.83 per share of warner disc + AT&amp;T 25.43)
2. Mid Value = $35.27
3. Low Value = $33.3
4. Conservative Value= $31.00

Extra scenario 1 - assume that AT&amp;T price drops to maintain a dividend yield of at least 6% (to be 1% higher than near competitor Verizon which has a safer dividend... = T Share price of $18.5

1. High value = $30.33 ($11.83 per share of warner disc + AT&amp;T $18.5)
2. Mid Value = $28.35
3. Low Value = $26.38
4. Conservative Value= $24.41

Extra scenario 2 - assume that AT&amp;T price drops to maintain a dividend yield of at least 7% (restored to the beloved 7%) = T Share price of $15.85

1. High value = $27.68 ($11.83 per share of warner disc + AT&amp;T $15.85)
2. Mid Value = $25.7
3. Low Value = $23.78
4. Conservative Value= $21.76

1305,investing,ChocolateTsar,"&gt;[**Apple**](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL) **wants another go in its legal battle against Epic Games.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**On Friday night,** [**Apple announced it would ask for a stay**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/apple-files-appeal-in-epic-games-case-that-could-delay-changes-.html) **on a judge’s** [**September order**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/epic-games-v-apple-judge-reaches-decision-.html) **saying Apple would have to allow apps to direct customers to external websites. That ruling would let app businesses circumvent Apple’s requirement to facilitate payments only inside of apps, where Apple takes up to a 30% cut. Apple is also appealing the ruling.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Because Epic Games is also appealing the nine counts it lost, it could take years before the case is resolved and Apple is forced to make any changes to iOS, the operating system for iPhones, as the two companies wrangle through the appeals process in court.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**The judge is expected to rule on Apple’s request for a stay next month.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple’s move is a surprising turnaround from its tone following the decision in September. While Apple always left open the possibility of an appeal, it portrayed the judge’s ruling as a resounding legal win for its App Store business model, which has come under fire from technology rivals, international regulators and members of the U.S. Congress.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We are very pleased with the Court’s ruling and we consider this a huge win for Apple,” Kate Adams, Apple’s lawyer, said in September following the ruling.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Friday night announcement inspired a torrent of commentary from Apple critics. They pointed out the move would preserve Apple’s App Store profits by preventing apps from using alternative payment systems. One company announced last week that it was already working on a [cheaper, web-based alternative to Apple’s app payments](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/developers-building-ways-to-skirt-apples-cut-of-in-app-purchases.html) \-- a move made possible only by the ruling that Apple is now appealing. Apple doesn’t disclose profit margins for the App Store, but it did [generate about $64 billion in gross sales in 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/apples-app-store-had-gross-sales-around-64-billion-in-2020.html).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Apple said it filed the appeal now because it faces a legal deadline this month. If Apple didn’t appeal now, it would forever lose the option, and it can always change its mind and withdraw the appeal. Apple also framed its appeal as a way to hold off a hasty business decision before the case is fully closed. The current order from the judge requires Apple to allow apps to link out to the web in December.**  
&gt;  
&gt;If the judge grants Apple the stay on the order next month, then the status quo will remain until Epic Games and Apple settle their beef. That could take years and help Apple resist more forced changes to its App Store model.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the meantime though, there are plenty of other external legal threats to Apple’s App Store. For example, a bipartisan bill in the in the Senate would [force Apple to accept alternative in-app payments](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/bipartisan-bill-targets-apple-and-googles-ability-to-profit-from-app-stores.html). Plus, Apple is already [forced to comply with a regulatory decision from Japan](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/01/apple-will-let-some-apps-guide-users-to-websites-to-make-payments-bypassing-apples-cut.html) to allow some apps to link out to websites. (The Japanese order does not apply to games, which is where most believe Apple makes the largest amount of App Store profit.)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Apple may have initially pitched the ruling in the Epic Games case as a win, but its appeal shows that it will protect its lucrative App Store model until the bitter end.**

**Abstract:**

&gt;While major stock market indices are followed by large monetary investments, we document that 
membership decisions  for  the  S&amp;P  500  index  have  a  nontrivial  amount  of  discretion.  We  show that  firms’  purchases of  S&amp;P  ratings  appear  to  improve  their  chance  of  entering  the  index  (but purchases  of  Moody’s  ratings do  not).  Furthermore,  firms  tend  to  purchase  more  S&amp;P  ratings when there are openings in the index membership. Such a pattern is also confirmed by an event study that explores a rule change on index membership in 2002. Finally, discretionary additions exhibit subsequent deterioration in financial performance relative to rule-based additions.

While we all knew tech has outperformed significantly over the past 20 years, how much its outperformed is kind of nuts.


So much so, that a 65 / 35  QQQ - Bonds Portfolio yielded higher total and risk-adjusted returns than the S&amp;P!!


Parameter
July 2007 to October 2021
Starting Balance: $10K
Monthly investments, $500
Rebalance: Quarterly

Results
QQQ (60 / 40):

SPY (100):
Final Balance: $317,894
Best year + 32.2%
Worst year -  36.8%
Sharpe - 0.64


Whats mind blowing is this is with regular quarterly rebalancing, throwing 35% of your recurring investment into bonds every quarter (where intuitively, one would likely want to roll bond allocation into more equity during significant downturns). Which is to suggest returns could be even higher with the most basic concept of market timing (i.e., investing 90/10 into qqq in midst of 08 financial crisis). Im not talking about plucking tops and bottoms with any serious level of precision.



Why is S&amp;P still the gold standard? How many decades does tech need to outperform before people acknowledge its here to stay and will only grow? We have millenials raised on tech now becoming the largest income earners. People have been waiting for tech to ""correct"" itself again for two decades, and lost out on significant return for a perceived benefit of diversification, when the reality is that even at 65/35 QQQ  you not only beat the S&amp;P but do so with definitively less risk as measured by sharpe &amp; drawdowns.

1557,investing,ButtBlock,"Was thinking tonight about how real estate has continued to become more and more expensive, (i.e. a good investment) over the past 70 years. However that price run up has been predicated both on the largest population explosion in human history, as well as artificial construction of supply, by NIMBYs and zoning laws in many parts of the world. 

I’ve always assumed that, aside from occasional collapses, real estate will continue to drift upwards, perhaps not a great investment compared to other assets, but better than inflation. 

The possibility exists of long term reversal of both of these supporting trends. Zoning laws are becoming threatened due to political backlash from how unaffordable housing has become. At the same time life in general has become so unaffordable that fertility rates are now strongly below replacement values in most of the developed world. 

Can’t say anything with any certainty of course, but I think a future of continued growth of housing prices for the next century isn’t a guarantee. Sounds obvious when I write it out, but psychologically I had a deep seated assumption that the housing market was a guaranteed success long term.  Think that may require a rethink. 

If population trends down in the developed world, that’s a possible future to consider when choosing investments. Fewer people could depress real prices of stocks in general.  Kind of difficult to know what types of companies would perform well in this scenario. I suppose technology companies specializing in automation (AI and robotics) is the only market I can think of that would do well. Commodities, construction, non-durables, energy, all of those seem to be at risk from a general long-term decline in population and therefore in aggregate demand.

Economic and regulatory environments have a huge influence on an economy’s performance because government policies hugely affect business operations. Investors should decide their investment strategies depending on how these government policies impact each industry and its elements.


Fiscal policy under Trudeau's Liberals Party is expected to remain loose, thus promoting businesses in general. The financial sector and renewable energy sector would have the maximum impact as the government is likely to impose a 3% tax on large banks and insurers, and might also remove fossil fuel subsidies within two years to reach a zero-emission target by 2050. Furthermore, the telecommunications industry might also witness some reforms as the government is eager to establish affordable and consumer-friendly internet and cellphone plans.

1607,investing,thebabaghanoush,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/september-jobs-report.html

The U.S. economy created jobs at a much slower-than-expected pace in September, a pessimistic sign about the state of the economy though the total was held back substantially by a sharp drop in government employment.

Nonfarm payrolls rose by just 194,000 in the month, compared with the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000, the Labor Department reported Friday. The unemployment rate fell to 4.8%, better than the expectation for 5.1% and the lowest since February 2020.

The headline number was hurt by a 123,000 decline in government payrolls, while private payrolls increased by 317,000.

The drop in the jobless rate came as the labor force participation rate edged lower, meaning more people who were sidelined during the coronavirus pandemic have returned to the workforce. A more encompassing number that also includes so-called discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons declined to 8.5%, also a pandemic-era low.

“This is quite a deflating report,” said Nick Bunker, economic research director at job placement site Indeed. “This year has been one of false dawns for the labor market. Demand for workers is strong and millions of people want to return to work, but employment growth has yet to find its footing.”

Nevertheless, markets reacted little to the news, with Dow futures around flat for the morning and government bond yields mixed as investors digested what was a mixed bag of a report.

Despite the weak jobs total, wages increased sharply. The monthly gain of 0.6% pushed the year-over-year rise to 4.6% as companies use wage increases to combat the persistent labor shortage. The available workforce declined by 183,000 in September and is 3.1 million shy of where it was in February 2020, just before the pandemic was declared.

“Labor shortages are continuing to put severe upward pressure on wages ... at a time when the return of low-wage leisure and hospitality workers should be depressing the average,” wrote Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.

Leisure and hospitality again led job creation, adding 74,000 positions, as the unemployment rate for the sector plunged to 7.7% from 9.1%. Professional and business services contributed 60,000 while retail increased by 56,000.

Job gains were spread across a variety of other sectors: Transportation and warehousing (47,000), information (32,000), social assistance (30,000), manufacturing (26,000), construction (22,000) and wholesale trade (17,000).

Local government education jobs fell by 144,000, which may have been due to seasonal adjustments in the numbers, according to Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC.

The survey week of Sept. 12 came just as Covid cases were peaking in the U.S. The delta variant spread since has cooled, with cases most recently dropping below an average of 100,000 a day.

Unemployment for Blacks fell to 7.9% from 8.8%, due largely to a drop to 66% from 66.7% in the labor force participation rate for males.

There was some good news in Friday’s report from previous months.

July’s already-strong gains were revised higher by 38,000 to 1.0913 million, while August’s big letdown also was revised up, to 366,000 from the initially reported 235,000.

The employment-to-population level increased to 58.7%, its highest since March 2020.

The report comes at a critical time for the economy, with recent data showing solid consumer spending despite rising prices, growth in the manufacturing and services sector, and surging housing costs.

Federal Reserve officials are watching the jobs numbers closely. The central bank recently has indicated it’s ready to start pulling back on some of the extraordinary help it has provided during the pandemic crisis, primarily because inflation has met and exceeded the Fed’s 2% goal.

However, officials have said they see the jobs market still well short of full employment, a prerequisite for interest rate hikes. Market pricing currently indicates the first rate increase likely will come in November 2022.

“After looking like almost a done deal, today’s jobs number has thrown expectations for tapering into disarray. The Fed doesn’t seem to need much to convince it that tapering should begin imminently, but at just 194,000, jobs numbers are suggesting that the labor market is further from hitting the substantial progress goal than they expected,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.","September’s jobs creation comes up short with gain of just 194,000 vs 500,000 expected",1633705496

By Marc Jones

LONDON (Reuters) -  Investment bank JPMorgan has estimated that troubled Chinese property  giant Evergrande and many of its major rivals have billions of dollars  worth of off-balance sheet debt that, once added on, ramp up their  leverage ratios.

JPMorgan's China and Hong Kong property analysts  said the tactic is likely to have been used to help firms look like they  were conforming with new borrowing cap rules introduced last year, but  Evergrande's case looks the most extreme.

""Instead  of true deleveraging, we think Evergrande has shifted some of the  interest-bearing debt to off-balance sheet debt,"" JPMorgan's analysts  said. ""Commercial papers, wealth management products and perpetual  capital securities, etc, which are not officially counted as debt.""

They  estimated Evergrande's ""net gearing,"" as debt as a ratio of a firm's  equity is known, was at least 177% at the end of the first half of the  year, instead of the 100% its accounts reported.

""It is possible  that the real gearing could be even higher, as data on some off-balance  sheet debt is not publicly available,"" JPMorgan added, saying the  ""disguised"" debt as it called it added up to 55% of Evergrande's overall  debt.

Other major firms whose gearing levels were likely to be  higher than formally reported included R&amp;F Properties at 139% versus  the 123%, Sunac China Holdings at 138% versus 87% reported and Country  Garden at 76% versus 50% reported.

But it seems - almost - every time there's a split, there's an increase in the stocks price as people buy in at the cheaper price, and maybe others sell X% after the split. What's stopping a company from splitting their stock often versus rarely?

If I had a company and I was adamant at keeping the stock low, could I split the stock every time it got to $100, so that it was around $50? Then after that split it jetted up to $100 within a year, could I split it again or would I have to wait for X years or some predetermined length of time?

However, unfortunately, inflation is currently on pace to hit 5%-6% by the end of the year. This means that that $100 that was invested into the index is now worth only ~$95 in real dollars.

Expects to reach a production capacity toward 9-10 billion in coating equivalent for masks come November, which could go to use on HVAC filters, gloves, and high-touch surfaces as these applications seek approval in 2022. Currently, management estimates they will receive earnings of $0.03-$0.06/mask.

It has been stated by management, that institutions in the U.S. simply cannot invest in ZEN due to it being on the pink sheets, Institutional ownership, again is at 0.03%. There is significant interest by these institutions, and I anticipate Uplistings to be a catalyst of their own due to the liquidity increase.

What is it worth when they offer a extremely effective solution to air quality for personal protection and passive filtration?

When they offer a potential medicine that kills bacteria, viruses, and fungus?

When they offer rapid-aptamer fluid derived tests for virtually every pathogen?

**Introduction**: There has been a lot of discussion as to the increase in money supply and inflation. Most seem to think that an increase in M2 inevitably leads to inflation in prices of goods and services. This couldn't be further from the truth. There was previously a strong correlation between the two up until 1990. From then on, the correlation has reversed and is negative. There is now a much stronger relationship between increases in the money supply and decreases in the velocity of money, meaning that money is not moving through the economy as it once did. This means that increases in the money supply are not getting spent. And as we all know, money must be spent to cause inflation. This is why economists are not overly concerned about the recent rapid rise in the money supply causing inflation.

So here are the four easy charts:

1. This [first chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQY4owBA5SP28Ng2glt_fG0jnDXTgwvsp-Q90VTA5_TTqrSZQRjkUTZeE1Zt5BOSxCnkHz-TX6HWu2z/pubchart?oid=809733064&amp;format=image) shows the correlation between the adjusted money supply and inflation. The M2 money supply is adjusted by subtracting real GDP. This amounts to the excess money beyond what is needed to grow real GDP. This has the strongest correlation with inflation. Inflation is measured by the implicit GDP price deflator, which measures the actual items that were spent in the year vs. a previous year's base price. You can use PCE or CPI, but the relationship is very similar. (Also I'm using an 8 year moving average because this gives the strongest correlation between the two variables. The correlation is very weak in concurrent periods, and gets a little stronger using 2 and 4 year moving averages.) You can see from this chart that the correlation was very strong from 1968, the first year of the 8 year moving average, through the end of 1990. R = 0.95 and R\^2 = 0.90. This indicates that 90% of changes in inflation can be explained by the changes in the adjusted money supply. This strong relationship has lead the general public to believe that the two variables are inherently related: That is, that the expansion of the adjusted money supply inevitably leads to inflation.
2. The [second chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQY4owBA5SP28Ng2glt_fG0jnDXTgwvsp-Q90VTA5_TTqrSZQRjkUTZeE1Zt5BOSxCnkHz-TX6HWu2z/pubchart?oid=2061624488&amp;format=image) shows the correlation from 1991-2021. You can clearly see that the relationship reversed. R= -0.50 R\^2 = 0.25. This indicates that the rate of inflation decreases as the adjusted money supply increases. It shows a moderate to weak relationship in which the increase in the adjusted money supply explains about 25% of the decrease in the rate of inflation. This can probably be explained by the fact that the money supply has seen its largest increases in periods when the economy was in recession and prices were falling. Needless to say, you can see that the former relationship between these two variables does NOT exist anymore and hasn't for 30 years!
3. This [third chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlyD-2fO9g1W3h6VFXV_r-CJo5MdLourVfNF5HMo_uG-8s1Rpu2293GA-_3LkBGbF_WM0CkWI61zXx/pubchart?oid=997615969&amp;format=image) shows the relationship between changes in adjusted money supply and changes in the velocity of money from 1960-1990. The velocity of money is the frequency of monetary transactions in the economy. You can clearly see that the relationship is negative, as the adjusted money supply increases, the number of transactions decreases. R = -0.63 R\^2 = 0.40. This indicates that 40% of the decrease in the velocity of money can be explained by the increase in the adjusted money supply. This is a moderately strong relationship.
4. This [last chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlyD-2fO9g1W3h6VFXV_r-CJo5MdLourVfNF5HMo_uG-8s1Rpu2293GA-_3LkBGbF_WM0CkWI61zXx/pubchart?oid=946401508&amp;format=image) shows the correlation of adjusted money supply and the velocity of money from 1991-2021. R= -0.98 R\^2 = 0.97. This indicates the strengthening of the relationship between increases in adjusted money supply and decreases in the velocity of money. You can clearly see that the more money that is pushed into the economy the less frequent that money gets spent.

**So where is all this money going if it is not going into goods and services?** Economist largely believe that increases in the money supply probably inflate assets, including real estate, stocks, bonds and all other capital and financial assets. PE ratios have been on the rise for 30 years now. The average TTM PE ratio from 1928-1990 was 13.8 times. Since then it is 21x. The 10-year treasury yield from 1928-1990 averaged 5.17%. Since then 4.19%, and 3% in the last 20 years. The are further examples, but I think you can see that the decoupling of the money supply and inflation has probably benefited asset prices.

**TLDR**: Increasing the money supply does NOT lead to inflation in products and services like it once did. It now results in a lower velocity of money, more savings and higher asset prices.",Why investors should not be worried about the expansion of the money supply causing inflation in four easy charts.,1633658717

1799,investing,stillness0072,"ChemoCentryx, Inc., (Nasdaq: CCXI), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved TAVNEOS (avacopan), an orally administered selective complement 5a receptor inhibitor, as an adjunctive treatment of adult patients with severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis (also known as ANCA-associated vasculitis or ANCA vasculitis), specifically granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) (the two main forms of ANCA vasculitis), in combination with standard therapy. ANCA-associated vasculitis is a systemic autoimmune disease in which over-activation of the complement system further activates neutrophils, leading to inflammation and eventual destruction of small blood vessels. This results in organ damage and failure, with the kidney as the major target, and is often fatal if not treated.

\- ADVERTISEMENT -

“Today is a momentous day in the history of ChemoCentryx; the culmination of decades of effort aimed at offering new hope to patients with this and other debilitating and deadly diseases,” said Thomas J. Schall, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of ChemoCentryx. “We look forward to making TAVNEOS available to clinicians and patients in the next few weeks. We thank the Agency for their collaboration and consideration and we are also immensely grateful to the pioneering scientists, clinicians and patients who believed in the promise of TAVNEOS and who have worked tirelessly to make it a reality, along with my dedicated and talented colleagues at ChemoCentryx.”

“I am excited that our work has helped lead to the first-in-a-decade approval of a medicine for ANCA-associated vasculitis. This is an important step forward in the treatment of this disease,” said the trial’s co-primary academic investigator Peter A. Merkel, MD, MPH, the Chief of Rheumatology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Director of the international Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium, and consultant to ChemoCentryx. “Patients will now have access to a new class of medication that provides beneficial effects for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis.”

“The vasculitis community is elated that TAVNEOS is now approved, bringing a much-needed new treatment option to patients living with this devastating disease,” said Joyce Kullman, Executive Director, Vasculitis Foundation. “There is a significant unmet need in the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis, with current therapies often leading to serious, even fatal, side effects and a diminished quality of life. We believe new therapies like TAVNEOS may offer a brighter future for these patients.”

TAVNEOS is the first FDA approved orally-administered inhibitor of the complement C5a receptor. The approval in ANCA-associated vasculitis was supported by the results of the pivotal Phase III ADVOCATE trial, which were highlighted in the February 2021 edition of *The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).* The ADVOCATE trial of TAVNEOS was a global, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, double-dummy Phase III trial of 330 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis in 20 countries. Eligible study subjects were randomized to receive either rituximab or cyclophosphamide (followed by azathioprine/mycophenolate) and either TAVNEOS (avacopan) or study-supplied oral prednisone. Subjects in both treatment groups could also receive non-protocol glucocorticoids if needed. The study met its primary endpoints of disease remission at 26 weeks and sustained remission at 52 weeks, as assessed by the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, or BVAS. The study demonstrated superiority to a prednisone-based standard of care with respect to sustained remission at 52 weeks. The most common adverse reactions (≥5% of patients and higher in the TAVNEOS group vs. prednisone group) were: nausea, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, fatigue, upper abdominal pain, dizziness, blood creatinine increase, and paresthesia.

ChemoCentryx has developed TAVNEOS Connect, a patient support program designed to assist patients who are prescribed TAVNEOS. To learn more about TAVNEOS Connect, or TAVNEOS, visit www.TAVNEOS.com.

ChemoCentryx is responsible for the discovery and development of TAVNEOS (avacopan) and owns the commercial rights to the drug in the United States. ChemoCentryx's Kidney Health Alliance with Vifor Pharma provides Vifor Pharma with exclusive rights to commercialize TAVNEOS in markets outside of the U.S.

TAVNEOS (avacopan) is also approved for the treatment of microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (the two main forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis) in Japan. The regulatory decision in Europe following the European Medicines Agency (EMA) review is expected by the end of 2021.

Hepatotoxicity: Serious cases of hepatic injury have been observed in patients taking TAVNEOS, including life-threatening events. Obtain liver test panel before initiating TAVNEOS, every 4 weeks after start of therapy for six months and as clinically indicated thereafter. Monitor patients closely for hepatic adverse reactions, and consider pausing or discontinuing treatment as clinically indicated (refer to section 5.1 of the Prescribing Information). TAVNEOS is not recommended for patients with active, untreated and/or uncontrolled chronic liver disease (e.g., chronic active hepatitis B, untreated hepatitis C, uncontrolled autoimmune hepatitis) and cirrhosis. Consider the risk and benefit before administering this drug to a patient with liver disease.

Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions: Cases of angioedema occurred in a clinical trial, including one serious event requiring hospitalization. Discontinue immediately if angioedema occurs and manage accordingly. TAVNEOS must not be re-administered unless another cause has been established.

Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation: Hepatitis B reactivation, including life threatening hepatitis B, was observed in the clinical program. Screen patients for HBV. For patients with evidence of prior infection, consult with physicians with expertise in HBV and monitor during TAVNEOS therapy and for six months following. If patients develop HBV reactivation, immediately discontinue TAVNEOS and concomitant therapies associated with HBV reactivation, and consult with experts before resuming.  


Serious Infections: Serious infections, including fatal infections, have been reported in patients receiving TAVNEOS. The most common serious infections reported in TAVNEOS group were pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Avoid use of TAVNEOS in patients with active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits before initiating TAVNEOS in patients with chronic infection, at increased risk of infection or who have been to places where certain infections are common.

**ADVERSE REACTIONS**  
The most common adverse reactions (≥5% of patients and higher in the TAVNEOS group vs. prednisone group) were: nausea, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, fatigue, upper abdominal pain, dizziness, blood creatinine increased, and paresthesia.

**DRUG INTERACTIONS**  
Avoid coadministration of TAVNEOS with strong and moderate CYP3A4 enzyme inducers. Reduce TAVNEOS dose when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors to 30 mg once daily. Monitor for adverse reactions and consider dose reduction of certain sensitive CYP3A4 substrates.

**About** **TAVNEOS™** **(avacopan)**  
TAVNEOS (avacopan), approved by the FDA as an adjunctive treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis, is a first-in-class, orally-administered small molecule that employs a novel, highly targeted mode of action in complement-driven autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. While the precise mechanism in ANCA vasculitis has not been definitively established, TAVNEOS, by blocking the complement 5a receptor (C5aR) for the pro-inflammatory complement system fragment known as C5a on destructive inflammatory cells such as blood neutrophils, is presumed to arrest the ability of those cells to do damage in response to C5a activation, which is known to be the driver of ANCA vasculitis. TAVNEOS’s selective inhibition of only the C5aR leaves the beneficial C5a pathway through the C5L2 receptor functioning normally.

ChemoCentryx is also developing TAVNEOS for the treatment of patients with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and Lupus Nephritis (LN). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted TAVNEOS orphan drug designation for ANCA-associated vasculitis and C3G. The European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation for TAVNEOS for the treatment of two forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis: microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis), as well as for C3G.

**About ANCA-Associated Vasculitis**  
ANCA-associated vasculitis is a systemic disease in which over-activation of the complement pathway further activates neutrophils, leading to inflammation and destruction of small blood vessels. This results in organ damage and failure, with the kidney as the major target, and is fatal if not treated. Currently, treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis consists of courses of non-specific immuno-suppressants (cyclophosphamide or rituximab), combined with the administration of daily glucocorticoids (steroids) for prolonged periods of time, which can be associated with significant clinical risk including death from infection.

**About ChemoCentryx**  
ChemoCentryx is a biopharmaceutical company commercializing and developing new medications for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and cancer. ChemoCentryx targets the chemokine and chemoattractant systems to discover, develop and commercialize orally-administered therapies. In the United States, ChemoCentryx markets TAVNEOSTM (avacopan), the first approved orally-administered inhibitor of the complement 5a receptor as an adjunctive treatment for adult patients with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis. TAVNEOS is also in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G). Additionally, ChemoCentryx has early-stage drug candidates that target chemoattractant receptors in other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and in cancer.

As we see more companies look to winding down property leases to increase their bottom line, there's 9.2 million jobs and $1.14 trillion in GDP potentially impacted by this shift (Source: [L.A. Times](https://www.latimes.com/b2b/cre/story/2021-06-15/commercial-development-and-operations-a-key-catalyst-for-u-s-economic-growth)).

So, the big question is what that shift looks like. There's the possibility of repurposing commercial space as retail and residential but that would take many years of rezoning, permits, retrofits, etc., and so some inefficiencies would arise, and the near term effect would still be a net decline in real estate value.

There will obviously also be some spaces retained for core staff, executive offices, meeting spaces, etc., but as the WeWork fiasco showed, the rank and file seem to be much more amenable to working from home than so-called dedicated coworking spaces.  How might this provide relief to related sectors, such as housing shortages with residential population booms? What does it do for income inequality?

1840,investing,Samich_Boi,"**Introduction**

Today I want to bring up one of the biggest potential plays of the 21st century. When people talk about big plays, they often include trend that have already risen to popularity. For example, the electric vehicle market. Many investors continue to speculate in potentially extremely high future revenue  electric vehicles. Why? Well, everyone and their mother understand that electric vehicles are an inevitability; that is, in the future, we will all have them! The classic example of identifying a trend before it's dominance would have been to buy EV stock before their prevalence back in as early as 2010. I'm sure you have heard comparisons before, but if you had put just $500 into Tesla as soon as it was listed back in 2010, you would have about 22 grand today. But what if you had bought it lower? As low as $5? You would have 77 grand! So why this example? Of course this is such wishful thinking right? Well, I'd like to believe that those investors who bought at $5 knew their future. They identified the EV market as a trend and ran with it, not caring whether they bought at 5 or 50. They knew the power of the EV market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Marijuana and Cannabis: A Future of Opportunity** 

I want to start by saying that the marijuana market has been one that has been talked about for a long time now. Global investors have been speculating in marijuana for a long time as many understand it's future global implications. However, right now, current marijuana stock market caps do not represent it's potential. Even investors in NIO and Tesla understand that these companies are just starting to get a global foot in the door; yet, they have been speculating the prices of these commodities for years before their importance in the global market. Why? One simple answer: legalization.

&amp;#x200B;

Recent news proves that many countries are leaning towards legalization. Efforts in several South American countries have arisen for legalization, with big legislative movements in Columbia and Panama recently. The American market is becoming increasingly lenient on cannabis with a future headed in marijuana as well, and federal legalization is currently in legislative talks with most states edging towards decriminalization. 

&amp;#x200B;

As older generations continue to pass, social stigma towards marijuana is going down. It is a matter of time before the marijuana market booms.

&amp;#x200B;

We already saw the potential of the marijuana market before. If we look at one of the biggest competitors in the American market, Tilray, we can see how price action has been so dependent on news. In May to June of this year, the entire marijuana market boomed with news about future legalization, but no major efforts were made. So what could happen if legalization WAS approved?

&amp;#x200B;

**The Global Contenders: Whose on Top?**

When taking into consideration the global marijuana market, no one is a clear leader right now. While news for many companies have come out about big deals, none of these deals have been dominant enough to actually promote enough growth that it's worth talking about. Or wait. Maybe there has been?

&amp;#x200B;

ENTER FLORA GROWTH CORPORATION. TICKER: FLGC

&amp;#x200B;

The news for this company has been good after good after good with falling prices, just what I like to see! What exactly does this mean? Big money is slowly accumulating shares. This community does not allow the posting of pictures; however, looking at the price action of FLGC, we can see that major accumulation efforts are being made at the $5 mark, just a few cents below where it is trading right now. Even the slightest drop below $5 and the price can shoot as high as 6 dollars intraday just to go right back down to 5. Shifty? Absolutely! Smart and bullish? YES! 

&amp;#x200B;

Big money wants to accumulate as much of this stock as they can, they see the future in it. Just in the past month, FLGC has signed several big moves, such as jumping into the Panama cannabis market, promoting a massive research plan with marijuana and cannabis, launching a European market campaign, and entering the American market via hemp textiles.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at production costs per gram makes FLGC look like a future monster. Flora produces marijuana at $0.06 a GRAM. For comparison, Tilray produces at $2.36 a gram and Sundial produces at $1.86 a gram.

&amp;#x200B;

Fundamentals become a tricky game to argue for Flora. While their growth is incredible, they are still losing money due to large loans. Is this a problem? I don't think so. I think by the end of this year, Flora will be boasting up to 10 times their revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

I highly recommend you inspect the Flora Growth price action, news, and fundamentals.

**The EV example**

So here you are. Looking at tesla back in 2011, $5 a share. You have seen it get tanked from it's IPO price and you have seen it drop even lower. Why would you invest in it.

**VTI (Total US Stock Market) $10,000 invested in 2002 would be $60,667 on October 1st, 2021**

**VGTSX (Total International Stock Market) $10,000 invested in 2002, would be $36,019 on October 1, 2021**

Facebook Inc.’s FB -5.52% platforms including WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook appeared to be down Monday, with users receiving error messages when trying to access the sites. 


Downdetector, a site that monitors website outages, posted to Twitter that the sites were down. The outages appeared to be widespread, with users in multiple countries affected, Downdetector’s website showed. But the full impact was unclear.


Andy Stone, a communications representative for Facebook, said the company is aware that people are having issues connecting with its apps and social-media sites. “We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience,” he said on Twitter.


The outage comes a day after the whistleblower who provided documents that formed the foundation of The Wall Street Journal’s Facebook Files series went public. Frances Haugen, a former product manager at Facebook, said she acted to help prompt change at the social-media giant.","Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp appear to be down and offline",1633367134
2026,investing,Connorvo,"I scraped every new performance grant CEOs received in 2017 to see if copying those trades would beat the market. The initial results are very promising (12-25% ɑlpha on average depending on the timeframe), but more research needs to be done!

# How it works:

I wrote a python script that scraped every single Form 4 filed in 2017. It was only looking for filings that matched the below criteria:

1. The grant was a Performance Grant. Performance Grants are used to reward executives with stock only if they reach certain performance targets (the listing is when the targets are set, not when the targets are achieved)
2. The Performance Grant targets were for the stock to reach specified price targets. This means that the executive would receive stock ***only*** if the stock hit certain price targets during the given timeframe
3. The executive receiving the grant was a CEO or President.
4. The grant was not regularly scheduled (i.e. it wasn’t a grant they would receive every year). FIltering these out makes it more likely that the grant was given because the CEO and Board of Directors have confidence that the stock can reach the price targets.

# Overall Results

These kinds of grants don’t happen very often, there were only 9 of them in 2017, but they did indeed beat the market.

Of the 9 stocks that were found, all of them peaked at a price more than 35% above the performance grant and 6 of them peaked up more than 100% in the 3 years following the grant.

The below table is the average returns by months since the performance grant for the SPY and the stocks I found.

Taking a slightly closer look at “Max Returns” in the table below, we can see it took anywhere from 141 days to 1088 days for the stocks to reach their max return since the grant. The average was \~700 days, meaning it takes about 2 years for most of the stocks to hit their peak.

You will also see that 6 of the 9 stocks reached their performance grant targets. 2 of the 3 stocks that didn’t reach their targets had insanely high targets of 160% and 260% stock returns and both of the stocks had well over 100% returns. The other target that wasn’t reached had a 58% target but was the worst-performing stock

This grant only had one vesting date, February 6, 2020, but the grant would vest if it hit the price targets at any point between the grant date and February 6, 2020. The stock had vesting targets at $11, $14, and $18. The stock fell about 14% over the next 2.5 months before then popping up to $10.20 (37% return) about 5 months after the grant date. The stock then had a looooong fall for the next \~1.5 years until February 6, 2020. The stock recovered and reached all the way up to $15 after COVID, but the performance grant had already expired so they never received any of the awards.

The grant could begin vesting immediately and they had 2.5 years to reach the goal. The stock price immediately started going up after the performance grant and reached a local maximum of $10.55 (85% return) 4 months after the initial grant before spending the next year and a half going down to below $7. This grant was an all-or-nothing grant where the price had to reach $16 within 2.5 years to vest. It never reached that goal but maxed out at $12.53 (120% return) about 2 years after the initial grant.

These grants could start paying out immediately upon hitting the $15 target and they had until the end of 2020 to hit that goal. Unlike most grants, they only gave an all-or-nothing $15 price target instead of tiered price targets that start out easier to hit. They never quite got to the $15 price target but did cross $13 (almost a 200% return) right around the 1-year mark.

It then tumbled again before reaching its overall maximum of almost $130 3 years later. Because the performance grant required at least one year to pass before reaching the target stock price would count towards the grant, the execs actually didn't start receiving the grant awards until the end of 2020 when the stock started going on a tear

This grant was only able to start paying out between the 1st and 3rd anniversary of the grant, so even though the execs hit the target price 9 months later, they didn't start getting paid out until close to the 3-year mark when they finally got above the target price again

# FAQs / Concerncs

***What is a Form 4?***

A Form 4 is filed any time an executive at a public company buys, sells, or is granted stock. They are required to file with the SEC within 3 days of taking the action

***Why did you pick 2017?***

Most performance grants have a timeline that is 3 years or shorter (though some are up to 5 years). 2017 ensures enough time has passed for the grant to actually play out

***Where did you get the data?***

The SEC has a database (EDGAR) that lets you scrape all of the info from all of the SEC filings

***Why did you pick the timeframes you chose (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months)?***

No particular rhyme or reason. I felt like these gave a pretty good overview of the short, medium, and long-term returns for each grant.

***9 stocks aren’t very many***

True. The sample size is very small. I am in the process of doing the analysis for more years to increase this number, but the number will never get very large as these types of grants don't happen super often.

**This isn't adjusted for risk in any way**

This is also true. These stocks vary from small to large market cap and have different levels of volatility which can affect the returns on a risk-adjusted basis. It may be worth diving into risk adjustments at some point, but right now I want to focus on gathering more data and seeing if there are any potentially viable investment strategies around the data.

# Takeaways

I definitely think this is promising, but the hard part is putting it into action. Obviously, if we could see the future and sell at the max price for all of the stocks, we’d all make millions, but the stocks don’t all just go up and to the right.

Some of them fall before popping, some pop and then fall, some pop then fall then pop even more.

There is potentially a viable strategy involving holding the stocks until they reach some return threshold (maybe like 25%) and then letting it run with a stop-loss, but I think I need more data to build better strategies.

2139,investing,Nootherids,"I am trying to better understand what are the best approaches to formulate several investment accounts that focus separately on short, medium, long, and retirement terms. The retirement I'm ok with as my 401k and Roth would operate with standard mutual fund principles. I am also fully aware of the concept of Dollar Cost Averaging.

What I'm trying to decipher in my head is understanding the link between the power of Compound Interest in combination to the above investment terms. I already understand the relation of compounding in the scope of dividends. You get the dividends and they get automatically reinvested, perfect. But my question here is related to stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs. I will lay out how I understand them (ignoring the concepts of dividends altogether, so let's assume none of them disburse any dividends).

Stocks: You buy at one price. The stock goes up in price accounting for your unrealized gains. You must sell your stock (at profit) to now have realized gains. Then you have to reinvest your entire investment amount, which is initial investment + realized profit, to achieve the concept of Compounding. I just don't think this seems very reasonable for a non-professional investor, am I correct in that opinion?

Mutual Funds: You buy at the current price of the fund. The fund is actively managed and buys and sells stocks as necessary. Each time it sells a stock at profit it creates a realized gain. That gain is disbursed automatically and acts as your Compounding interest. My question is does this happen regularly or sporadically? Meaning are you actually realizing a true Compounding effect here or not really?

ETFs: They are mutual funds that act like stocks. I read some places that they will auto-reinvest any dividends they disburse but I don't know how. And since they are not actively traded then holding any ETF for the long term will not create any Compounding effect, unless you play them as stocks like stated above. Am I wrong here too?

Conclusion...Gains in the market whether stocks, funds, or ETF, are always referred to as Annualized Returns. What I'm trying to grasp my head around are whether general Gains in the market are indicative of ""Simple Interest"" or ""Compound Interest""? And being that Compound Interest is so powerful from a long term perspective, should I just stop thinking about Compounding altogether (assuming I'm not looking specifically for dividend yielding investments ATM) while I'm making these decisions? I keep running calculators seeing how an investment would grow depending on variables and of course it asks what the annual interest rate is; but some ask for compounding rate and some don't. So I don't really know which I should be looking at.

Note...I am looking to invest an initial amount of roughly $5-$20k spread over 3-4 accounts for different time frames, and injecting about $2k per month (total, not each). Just so you understand that I'm not talking amounts in the hundreds of thousands here. But being that my funds are relatively limited and I don't want to make the wrong decisions, I realized that I'm getting a bit stuck in Analysis Paralysis. So I come to you fine people. TIA

Bonus Question: Are ETF prices set by the changes in supply/demand from traders like stocks are, or are they set by the index that they track? Meaning, can the index signify that the ETF should be at $50, but investor sentiment crash the ETF down to $0, like they could with a stock? Or make it skyrocket like GME? Meaning are things like technical or price action analysis what investors use to determine the price or is the price actually linked to the underlying securities and investors just ride the wave up and down?",Stock/Funds/ETF Gains: Unrealized vs Realized vs Compound [Question],1633317839

2159,investing,guanciallee,"There are a lot of disclaimers for this post that are extremely important. As a result, I have included them at the end indicated like so ^**1**. Additionally, I walk through the math so that everyone can understand the process and for people wanting to critique/question. There is a TL;DR at the end but without context, it's pretty unbelievable. 

### Sourcing Data
Every list of American Mutual funds has slight errors (even this [one](https://investexcel.net/complete-list-of-mutual-funds-across-all-international-exchanges/)). So I created a list with [Market Watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/mutual-fund/list?firstLetter=A) of around 25,000 mutual fund tickers. Most mutual funds have multiple different tickers because of different shares/classes. Each class contains the same investments it's just variations on your fee structure ^**1**. So I counted only one example from each mutual fund ^**2**. This is controversial but I believe it will give the most accurate results. [This](https://imgur.com/a/BI4vCvB) example I would have kept two because there are only two mutual funds here. You shouldn't include every share/class because it will have an overrepresentation of certain mutual funds.

I used the stock history function in Excel to find the price of each ticker on the 1st of every year since 1990^**3**. If it didn't have a price I got rid of it for that particular year. For context at the beginning of 2021, I have around 6700 unique mutual funds in my list^**4**. 

###The Math
I did the following calculations for every American Mutual Fund since 1990 ^(**5** Big disclaimer). First I calculated the percent change from each first day of the year to the next first day of the year (2020 Jan 2/2019 Jan 2)-1. Many people calculate change inside of a year but I did the math for gains of a year gap instead. As long as I use the same timeframe every time the math is sound. The percent amounts might be slightly different than what is commonly publicized. Secondly, I calculated the percent change from the beginning of every year from 1990 until now ^**6** (1990-Now, 1991-Now, 1992-Now Etc.). 

I chose these two calculations because one is a very common attribute (year difference) and since most people buy and hold mutual funds for many years I wanted to see what the result would be holding for many years until now. I then calculated averages for these two distinct calculations for each year. As well as trimming 2.5% Top+Bottom and 10% Top+Bottom of mutual funds to exclude outliers and calculating a new percentage with that (keeping all 3 results for each calculation/year). 

###Index Funds
I chose S&amp;P500 (.INX) Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) and Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) and found their historical prices via Google Sheets. The same math calculations were done for the same timeframe gaps (i.e single year gaps and each year until now gaps). 

###Analysis
I started by comparing the 'each year till now' percentages for mutual funds to the three indexes. I can also calculate what percentage of mutual funds each index is higher than in each specific calculation. Here are the results from [1990-Now](https://imgur.com/a/Ga3pSNq). It becomes quite apparent that the order of best returns goes Nasdaq, S&amp;P then Dow Jones. Each Index normally beats out  90%+ of Mutual funds for each timeframe (sometimes 98%+). Even if you bought at the peak of the dot-com bubble (2000) or before the 2008 crash, each index would still beat the overwhelming majority of Mutual funds from that same time frame. If you knew to buy any index in the '90s it's a slaughter. 


Looking at only this data doesn't take into account a random great year for an index fund. As well there is a common notion that Mutual funds might not gain much but they shield you from losses. Let's address that by diving into the other calculation I did with the percent change from a year to the next year. 


Here is [1990-Now](https://imgur.com/a/wSEychd). Red cells indicate when an index is lower than the average mutual fund from that year. The results are when the indexes are down the average mutual fund is also very much down (Out of the 8 times S&amp;P closed negative since 1990 4 times it still outperformed the average mutual fund). There has never been a year where any index was negative yet the average mutual fund was positive. The indexes are usually beating 55-90% of mutual funds every year (With them beating 90%+ many times). Dow has beaten the average yearly mutual fund return 66% of the time in the past 30 years, S&amp;P &amp; Nasdaq being 80%. The dot-com bubble is the exception to the stellar performance where a difference between index funds and mutual funds is notable.

###Conclusion

Picking a mutual fund that somehow outperforms any index is a massive uphill battle because the indexes usually beat 55-90% of mutual funds every year (with them beating 90%+ many times). Normally you hold mutual funds for many years, so even if you succeed in choosing a winner one particular year you will still eventually lag behind the index funds. The longer timeframe the more likely (Index funds beating 92%+ of mutual funds over time is the norm)

You can make a lot of observations from this data and that's what I am going for. Make your own conclusions but keep in mind most statistics relating to the mutual fund world are not primary sources. Most of the time people are trying to convince you to buy Mutual Fund XYZ. This post is primary research where you could easily replicate my findings. 

The biggest flaw to this data is the fact that we've been in a record bull market which means aggressive investments look better in hindsight. That's why looking at both calculations I did is important, so you can see a clearer picture. You could easily do much more math to find patterns before the current record bull market. For example, calculate percent changes from various timeframes such as 1990-2018, 1991-2018 or 1990-1995, 1991-1996 or 1990-1992, 1990-1993, etc. I can calculate and post some of them if people request them. This is not financial advice.


### TLDR
The overwhelming majority of mutual funds can't compete with either Dow, Nasdaq, or S&amp;P any way you slice the data. They don't come close to competing in terms of gains and still perform badly in years when the index funds perform badly (they sometimes perform even worse during these years, the dot-com bubble is the exception). You get roughly the same amount of losses but with only a slight portion of the gains. Even if you choose a mutual fund winner one year your multi-year investment will eventually lag behind the index funds by quite a lot.

^(**5** Flaw in my data here is that I can't find old historical lists of mutual funds while also finding the historical prices of said mutual funds. I can only find a current list of mutual funds and historical prices of whatever is currently listed. This is an example of survivorship bias because I won't have the data for any mutual funds that were available but delisted before 2021. As I move further back in time my original list of 6700 mutual funds shrinks every year. If I had to guess this influences my results in my post to be slightly higher returns than the truth. This is because any mutual funds that performed horribly and delisted before 2021 wouldn't be included in my math above.)

2206,investing,Dragoon1311,"  Maybe a good play with rising Ukraine Gas prices:

KUB (CAD) / TPNEF (USD) looks even better with Ukraine Gas prices rising to 18,000 MCM (valuta is UAH). 18,000 MCM in September (Cubic Meters, Before VAT/Taxes) according to the table on the website and last quarter was an average of $6.50 MCF (Cubic Feet, After VAT/Taxes) in the MD&amp;A Q2. This was with an average 9,400 MCM (April - June) on the website. Meaning Gas prices will be up with 66% in Q3 (upcoming numbers) compared to Q2. KUB uses no hedges.

In Q2 2021 KUB made 500K USD profit. RK field with electricity was only online for half the quarter, 100K profit, but using the numbers it can be 200K USD so 250K CAD in profit. This means that the Gas business was 500K CAD profit with all 'fixed costs' included and September is more than double the Gas prices (after VAT/Taxes).

I look forward to next Quarter (Q3) with the average at 15,600 MCM (July - September) compared to 9,400 in Q2. A 66% increase.

So this should be strong earnings in Q3 and then clean books when this sales deal closes, de-risking from Eastern Ukraine. Trading below Cash and Equity (not taking into account the RK field in the books) after this deal. I believe the cash will mostly be used to further develop the RK field.

Cybin is a budding Toronto-based biotech company whose goal is to produce psychedelic-based therapeutic medicines for addressing various mental health issues. The psychedelic in question is Psilocybin, the active compound found in so-called “magic mushrooms”. They aim to do this through proprietary drug discovery, new drug delivery systems, and new formulation and approaches for different psychiatric disorders. For the most part, these psychiatric disorders include Major Depressive Disorder and several types of substance abuse including alcohol and nicotine. Millions around the world are afflicted by these issues, and of course that comes with a multi-billion dollar healthcare opportunity.

[**Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 2017 – Alexander Belser et. al.**](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6022582598960827c7789b33/603d2d72126ce0c8a33f0f14_Patient%20experiences.pdf)

This study bills itself as the “first qualitative study of participant experiences in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy”. It was a relatively small study with only 13 participants aged 22 to 69 with an average age of 50 years. All were affected by elevated anxiety associated with a cancer diagnosis. They were provided doses of psilocybin and therapy – and the transcripts from those therapy sessions were analyzed to find common themes.

Among all or most of the subjects reported easing of their symptoms and a desire to repeat the experience of taking psilocybin. Some participants showed strong positive reactions to the treatment, such as improved relationships and catharsis of powerful emotion.

The overall conclusion of the study is that psilocybin-assisted therapy may provide an effective treatment for psychological distress in cancer patients.

Some background on the main author –

Alexander Belser holds a PhD in Counseling Psychology from New York University and was a clinical research fellow at Yale 2018-2019. He has spent a couple of decades researching the possibility of psychedelic based clinical treatment with several peer-reviewed journal articles. 2015-2017 He also served on the Board of Advisors for Compass Pathways – a well-known mental health care company. **He is the Chief Clinical Officer of Cybin as of November 2020.**

[**Elsevier Journal of Psychiatry Research, 2020 – Simon Goldberg, et. al.**](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6022582598960827c7789b33/603935b9a45a717eeb9287d5_Meta-analysis%20-%20experimental%20effects%20of%20psilocybin%20on%20symptoms%20of%20anxiety%20and%20depression.pdf)

In this meta-analysis, 117 participants were studied across 4 groups; 3 with randomized-placebo controlled tests and 1 uncontrolled. All participants were clinically evaluated to be experiencing elevated levels of anxiety and/or depression. Biases attempted to be mitigated through study design included selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias.

Analysis showed an “evident” effect with statistically significant reductions in anxiety and/or depression systems based on clinical evaluation. Adverse reactions were minor and subsided within a few hours; no long term or serious adverse reactions were recorded.

The meta-analysis provided a few concessions – first that there were only four studies totaling 117 participants. There was a high risk of bias, including the fact that all participants must have been willing to take a Schedule I substance, and that three of the four studies involved cancer patients who may not otherwise be experiencing anxiety and/or depression. There was also limited diversity among subjects (58.25% Female, 86.33% White).

[**JAMA Psychiatry, 2020 – Alan Davis, et. al.**](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6022582598960827c7789b33/6039314ec645352a335785ab_Jama_Psychiatry_Davis_2020_Psilocybin_MDD.pdf)

This study sought out to study the effect of psilocybin therapy on patients with Major Depressive Disorder. It studied a pool of 27 participants aged 21 to 75 who all were afflicted by MDD and not currently using antidepressant medications. There was also a focus on cancer patients and other treatment-resistant cases of MDD. The participants were split into two groups of immediate treatment and 8-week delayed treatment.

Ultimately, the study found statistically significant improvements in the clinically evaluated MDD among the participants including half of them in remission by week 4 of the study. The study compared the efficacy of Psilocybin to Ketamine (an already prescribed drug) but with an effect lasting about twice as long (4 weeks versus 2 weeks for Ketamine). Psilocybin, like most psychedelics, also has a low likelihood of addiction (unlike Ketamine).

The study posits that this method of therapy could also be useful for treating a variety of psychiatric conditions including substance abuse disorders.

Although the science is still relatively young, Psilocybin shows positive results in a variety of studies, and has done so for a number of years. What is left is to harness the power of this drug the way we need it to be used.

**3.** **The Cybin Approach (Development Pipeline)**

Not a lot of analysis in this section, but to continue setting the stage here is Cybin’s “three-pillar” approach to drug development –

*1. Novel Drug Discovery Platform - API Modification*

Develop new APIs via selective modifications of tryptamine and phenethlyamine-based scaffolds specifically to alter their pharmacokinetics without modifying their therapeutic potential. (Changing the way drugs move through the body without reducing their effects)

Modifications involve replacing selective hydrogens with deuterium atoms.

Optimizing unique physicochemical attributes e.g. salts, crystal forms, co-crystals, etc.

Pillar One is all about discovering and creating compounds for more efficient drug design.

*2. Proprietary Drug Delivery Systems – Research and Develop*

Efficient delivery system that attempts to bypass the liver metabolism with a direct path to the brain providing faster onset (sublingual distribution).

Modified-release formulations with the potential to reduce side effects and to control exposure.

Dose control through proprietary device platform.

Delivery systems may be applied to many psychedelic compounds.

Pillar Two is all about controlling the way the isolated compound is administered, allowing for varying dosages and reliable medication times – this way patients can get the therapeutic effects of Psilocybin without feeling “high” and being potentially incapacitated for several hours.

*3. Innovative Treatment Regimen – Science Meets Technology*

Software-based platform to gather clinical research data from psychedelic treatment.

Machine learning-based data analytics for improved patient outcomes. 

Patient therapy and integration support.

Pillar Three is all about leveraging technology and data analysis to create effective drugs and treatment plans. This is where they will utilize their partnership with tech startup Kernel, who has created “Flow” – a non-invasive brain monitoring interface. Kernel Flow is like a motion-capture helmet for the head, but utilizes over 1000 sensors to monitor, image, and record precise brain activity with a rate of 200 samples per second. This data will be used to create patient-specific treatment plans.

**4.** **Achievements and In-Progress**

In this section we won’t bother to address superfluous awards or honorary mentions, but instead will focus on actual business activities.

So far they have 15 patent filings, including international patents, which cover a variety of things including novel psychedelic compounds, integration of delivery platforms, methods of use in psychiatric indications, and the drug discovery pipeline of modified and novel ergolines, tryptamines, and phenethylamines. There over 50 molecules covered by these patents.

On the drug development side, there are currently 4 active drug programs –

CYB003-005 cover three drugs who are being designed to respectively treat alcohol abuse, anxiety disorders, and the last to be used for general psychiatry and neurology. These three are still in their pre-clinical phases.

CYB001 is the flagship drug, isolated and modified psilocybin in a sublingual (under-the-tongue) film delivery used to treat Major Depressive Disorder. CYB001 is intended to begin Phase IIA trials by the end of this year, to be followed up with Phase IIB. In the clinical trial system, Phase I provides small doses to subjects and they are observed for extreme side effects or other danger. While completion of Phase I does not necessarily mean the drug is effective, it shows that in a controlled setting the drug is safe to use – and several participants still report positive effects. In Phase II, a larger group of people are split into various treatment groups with varying levels of drug dosage. Placebos are not used in Phase IIa. Phase II will verify that the drug works to some extent, will provide effective data on proper dose ranging (i.e. finding ideal minimum and maximum doses), and will also potentially reveal less-common adverse effects. So long as Phase II still indicates the drug is safe and possibly effective, the drug will move to Phase III which involves the intense scrutiny of double-blind studies, placebos, etc. and is the final phase before being released to market.

In CYB001 Phase IIa, 40 patients will evenly split into treatment groups to be given dosages in the range of 1mg, 3mg, 5mg, 7mg, and 25mg. Phase IIb will examine a group of 120 patients, 80 of which will receive a dose based on the data from IIa, and the remainder will receive a placebo. Phase II will take a total of 12 months, so a Phase III would not be expected until at least 2023, with probably 2024 being the year brought-to-market assuming everything goes well.

CYB003 and 004 are “near” human studies, but no estimated date yet. 

**5.** **Other Notes**

This write-up could really be miles long, but I definitely don’t have the discipline for that. I’m not a financials guy, so I couldn’t tell you much about how they’re doing in this startup phase of the company. So far, the company has managed to raise around C$120M.

The team at Cybin is diverse which includes: the former Ontario Health Minister, the former COO of Loblaws, Canada’s largest food and drug retailer, investment banking experience involving the execution of billions of dollars’ worth of mergers and acquisitions, experienced “new age drug” investment with previous work in cannabis startups, decades of experience in the healthcare industry, and much more.

Obviously, the biggest risk to investing in this company is that they cannot create an approved drug, or it just isn’t that effective. This however does create a large upside, and at around $2.10/share, there is potential to even have a 2x bagger just on news that they’re moving to Phase III trials. An actual drug may be able to bring 4-5x returns by around 2024-25.",Sharing Research on Cybin (CYBN) - A New Psychedelic Pharma Company,1633100252

Now that Q3 is over we have a full picture of the transactions that occurred and can (hopefully) predict the outcome of Q3 revenue. OPEN provided guidance of $1.9 - $2B for Q3. 

I used ibuyerstats.com to analyze all transactions. In Q3, I calculated an estimated 9,218 homes were removed from the website. At an average value of $345,000 per home, that would total $3.18B in revenue. However, using Q2 data from the website and press release I was able to determine that 12% of the homes removed from listing were removed for purposes other than a sale. Therefore, if you remove the 12% (assuming this stays close to consistent in Q3) I estimate revenues will land around $2.7B. Not often do you see 40% beats on revenue estimates, but this is very possible.

I believe these dates indicate historical Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) activity associated with GameStop and provide an indication of what to expect as we move towards **9/30/2021** and onward.

Background

In January, February 2021 $126.6 billion of loans were said to have been repriced ([S+P Global - March 12th, 2021](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/quick-take-us-clo-refinancing-and-reset-activity-surges-63108875)).

Archegos was liquidated between March 12th and March 26th, 2021 ([Credit Suisse - July 29th, 2021](https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/investor-relations/financial-disclosures/results/csg-special-committee-bod-report-archegos.pdf)). It’s been said that the firm turned **$10 billion into an estimated $100 billion** worth of assets ([Bloomberg - April 3rd, 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-03/the-number-of-the-week-is-100-billion)).

&gt;“Typically, for new-issue transactions, the CLO debt tranches are collectively 10 times the size of the notional amount of the equity interest.” - [https://www.stout.com/en/insights/article/primer-valuation-clo-equity-financial-reporting](https://www.stout.com/en/insights/article/primer-valuation-clo-equity-financial-reporting)

On March 26th, 2021 the Fed reported a daily Reverse Repurchase amount of $11.4 billion. By March 31st, the daily Reverse Repurchase amount skyrocketed up to $134 billion. An increase of $124.297 billion. ([St. Louis Federal Reserve - RRP Chart](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/)). This was notable because the Fed’s RRP activity had been effectively dormant until this uptick.

Hypothesis

As evidenced by the volume of CLO repricing in Jan/Feb, the end date of the Archegos liquidation, proportion of equity compared to total Archegos assets and uptick in RRPs on March 31st, 2021 my reading leads me to believe that Archegos was more of a CLO Manager than Family Office and that some of their positions (illiquid investments in junk-grade CLOs) were auctioned off and then repriced to SOFR at the end of March 2021.

Historically CLOs were priced off 3-month LIBOR but, out of concern the benchmark was being manipulated by financial institutions, the Federal Reserve is in the process of transitioning CLOs to their own rate called SOFR that is based on the daily RRP amounts ([Bloomberg - July 8th, 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/growing-clo-market-has-a-libor-transition-problem-on-horizon)).

9/30/2021 is 3 days away and represents the 2nd-ever quarterly refinancing of CLOs after the formal recommendation of SOFR was made by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ([AARC](https://www.newyorkfed.org/arrc)) on July 29th, 2021.

There is a process called “Warehousing” in the CLO world where “CLO Managers purchase initial collateral before the closing date” which typically lasts 3-6 months ([Pinebridge - September 19th, 2019](https://www.pinebridge.com/en/insights/clo-beyond-the-complexity)).

**9/30/2021 represents the 6-month mark since Simplex filed their 80,702 PUT contracts**.

GME close on 3/31/2021: $189.82

GME close on 6/30/2021: $214.14

GME close on 9/30/2021: ???

Conclusion

While many of my posts have historically shied away from dates I believe the evidence here is too clear and strong to avoid mention. Worth noting 9/30/2021 is just *a* date and, given the fact the average tenor of Archegos’ contracts was 24 months, there could be many other interesting ones as well.",Why I’m Expecting a Big Week for GME,1633117019

However I didn't see any mention on how a bond's maturity will affect the earning. For example:

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say a company issues a 10-Y 5% $1000 bond, so each year it has to pay $50 in interests, it's gross earning is $200.   


So $200 - 50 (interests) -30 (depreciation) -10 (amortization) -20 (taxes) = $90 net earning per year, meaning that if earning doesn't increases the company won't be able to pay back it's $1000 debt upon maturity, even though the interested payments are fully covered. Shouldn't the company be setting money aside for the bond's maturity, and shouldn't that be deducted from it's earning like depreciation and amortization?  


also, what's keeping the stockowners from giving themselves a $90 dividend and giving the middle finger to the bondholders? (the company would still be paying the interests, and would not default until the 10-Y maturity, so the stockowners could milk it for 10 years)",How does a Bond's maturity affects the earning statement of a company?

But while the most obvious example of this would be, say, spending 50 dollars to buy a share of a stock, and the stock price increases. you now spent money to make money. But isn't that the only option with *everything* and *anything* at this point? there is no point in saving money, so your only other option is to spend that money to invest it, whether it is in yourself, the stock market, or something physical that has value, such as a house or business you own yourself.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000119312521289903/d157488ds1.htm

Rivian Automotive, a company developing electric vehicles, including commercial delivery vans for Amazon, filed for an initial public offering on Friday. The company aims to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “RIVN.”

Its paperwork shows a $994 million net loss on zero revenue in the first six months of 2021. In 2020 the company’s net loss came to $1.02 billion.

The company wrote in its filing, “We are a development stage company and have not generated material revenue to date. Vehicle production and deliveries began in September 2021.” Rivian beat Tesla, GM and Ford to the market with an electric pickup, the R1T, which has received glowing early reviews. The company plans to launch a seven-passenger SUV called the R1S in December, it said in the filing.

CEO RJ Scaringe, who has a Ph.D. from the Sloan Automotive Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, founded Rivian in 2009. The company is based in Irvine, Calif., with 6,274 employees as of the end of June. It operates a vehicle assembly plant in Normal, Illinois.

Amazon and Ford each own more than 5% of the company. Peter Krawiec, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide corporate and business development, sits on Rivian’s board.

Rivian’s commercial vehicle business will be highly dependent on Amazon for the foreseeable future. The company said Amazon has some exclusive rights to purchase electric delivery vehicles from Rivian for at least four years, and the right of first refusal after that.

Like Tesla, Rivian remains a non-unionized automaker for now. The company’s filing acknowledged that this status could change and impact labor costs.

2348,investing,Market_Madness,"#**Introduction**
Everyone talks about what to invest in, but they often skip a step when talking to beginners. What to invest in starts with knowing what is available. Here are the fundamental investment types I will be covering today:


* Stocks – fractional ownership of a company sold in the form of shares
* Bonds – a loan to a company or government that will pay interest in the future
* Commodities – a raw material or agricultural product that can be bought or sold
* Mutual Funds and ETFs  – containers holding many stocks, bonds, or commodities


Each of these have their own unique set of attributes and uses. They’re differentiated based on risk, specialization, and ease of use. I might go into these details in the future, but for now I want to start at the very beginning. 

#**Stocks**
Let’s say you own a business. You currently only have one location but would like to open another. You know your business is worth about $1 million dollars and that it costs $100,000 to open a new store. You decide to create 10,000 shares and attempt to sell them for $100 each. Each share represents a 0.01% ownership stake in the company. Let’s say you sell 2,000 of the shares. Now you own 8,000 shares and the person or people you sold the shares to own 2,000. This means you own 80% of the company and the others own 20%. They paid you $200,000 for those shares which you can now use to open two new stores. 

So why did the people in the example buy $200,000 worth of your business’s stock? People buy stocks for two primary reasons. The first is that they expect the business to do well. A business that does well will grow and increase the value of its shares. This is called capital appreciation. If you go ahead and builds two more stores that generate the same income as the first, the value of the business will have roughly tripled. The $200,000 that was invested could now easily be worth $600,000. On the other hand, what if you tried to open two new stores and they both failed? Everyone would see that you’re bad at running this business and those shares might only be worth $100,000 now. The second reason is to collect dividend payments from the business. A dividend is when a company takes a portion of its earnings and pays them out to its shareholders. These are more common among older well established businesses that have consistent income.

Stocks are most commonly traded on stock exchanges. The United States is home to the two largest exchanges in the world, the New York Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq Stock Market. To buy or sell stocks yourself on the exchanges you need to go through a brokerage. This might sound like a daunting process but can usually be set up in less than 15 minutes. Once you have an account set up and money deposited buying and selling shares is nearly instantaneous. 

#**Bonds**
When you need to make a large purchase like a new car you don’t typically pay it all up front. You might not have enough money at the moment or want a way to spread the purchase out over time. To do this you get a loan. Let’s say you want to buy a $20,000 car. You spend $4,000 on the down payment and agree to pay the rest over the next three years. You get to take the car home today because the loan pays the dealership the remaining amount owed. In return for lending you this money the bank is going to charge interest as you pay the loan back. Let’s assume the interest rate is 3% per year. At this rate you’ll end up paying the bank back about $16,751. The additional $751 is their payment for taking on the risk of loaning you that money.

Bonds and loans have a lot in common. They’re both used to finance expensive purchases, have interest rates, and cover a set period of time. There are some differences though. The car loan was paid off in monthly payments over the course of three years. Each monthly payment paid some of the interest as well as some of the initial $16,000 principal. Let’s say you’re the bank. Instead of writing a car loan you use the money to buy a bond worth $16,000 at the same 3% interest rate over the same three year period. As the holder of the bond you would be entitled to interest rate payments, twice per year, for three years. Each semiannual payment would be 1.5% of $16,000 or $240. After three years the bond would mature, you would receive your last interest payment, and you would receive your entire $16,000 back.

Let’s take a look at how stocks and bonds compare. Both of them can be used to raise money, but they do so in significantly different ways. When you buy stock you are buying a fractional ownership in the business. You do not get your initial investment back unless the company pays dividends, or you sell your shares and give up ownership. Bonds can also be used to raise money, but they do not offer any ownership. When a company sells bonds it knows that it will have to pay them back in the future which can be costly. When it sells stock its current shareholders lose some of their ownership and therefore value. Let’s say there are 100 shares of company XYZ and they decided to issue 20 more. Previously every share was worth 1% of the company, now every share is only worth 0.83% of the company. This is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding what stocks and bonds are and how they compare to each other. 

#**Commodities**
Stocks and bonds are each considered to be an asset class. An asset class is a group of investments that have similar characteristics and have to follow the same regulations. Stock in Apple is not the exact same as stock in Visa, but they serve the same purpose, can be traded the same way, and follow the same rules. The same can be said about bonds. A bond that takes seven years to mature is not the exact same as one that takes ten years, but they are both going to be structured the same. The third asset class we will be covering are commodities.

A commodity is a raw material or primary agricultural product. These products are essentially the same regardless of where they come from. Copper, gold, oil, iron, and lumber are all examples of raw material commodities. Corn, soybeans, meat, and milk are all agricultural commodities. There may be minor fluctuations in quality, but in order to be traded on exchanges they need to meet a minimum requirement. These materials form the foundation of almost everything our economy produces. 

Unlike with stocks or bonds, commodities are not used as a way to raise money. They’re traded as a way to protect the producer from risk. Let’s say you can grow 10,000 bushels of wheat in a good year. You would like to get at least $8 per bushel once it’s harvested. What happens if there is a perfect year for crops and everyone else has produced more than expected. This increase in supply pushes the price lower because buyers have more to choose from. The price per bushel is now only $5. In this situation you would only earn 63% as much as you were forecasting which can be hard to handle as a business. In order to protect yourself from this situation you might want to create a contract with a wheat buyer on an exchange. This contract could include you agreeing to sell your wheat for $7 per bushel at the end of the summer. This is less than the $8 you are hoping for, but it will be guaranteed. Assuming the person buying the contract was also expecting wheat to be worth $8 per bushel, they will see this as a good deal. When prices for materials are known in advance it’s easier to budget and plan which is a benefit for both parties. 

Odds are you aren’t looking to buy or sell massive quantities of wheat, or any other raw materials. If you’re looking at investing in commodities it’s probably going to be in oil, gold, or common metals like copper. Thankfully you don’t need to be directly trading contracts with the producers to do this. There are shares that can be bought and sold like stocks on a stock exchange. Each share represents a fixed amount of the commodity, such as an ounce of gold or a barrel of oil. The primary reason people buy commodities is to protect themselves from inflation. This works because as the price of things increase, the price of the raw materials must also increase. 

#**Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds**
Now that you have an idea of what the three most popular asset classes are, let’s take a look at a couple of the tools associated with them. Mutual funds and ETFs are both collections of stocks, bonds, or commodities that can be traded. Instead of hand selecting companies, bonds, or commodities these collections allow you to purchase a fraction of many of them all at once. 

The S&amp;P 500 is an index that tracks 500 of the largest companies in the United States. It’s often used as a general gauge for the US economy. If the economy is doing well and growing, this index will also be growing. Instead of having to purchase shares in all 500 businesses by hand there are numerous ETFs that will do that for you. The most popular one has a ticker name of SPY. When you buy a share of SPY, 5.9% of your money is being put in Apple stock, 2.29% is put into Facebook stock, and so on. The larger the company the larger the fraction of your money they get. This is called a market cap weighed fund. 

SPY is an ETF which means you can buy or sell it at any time with ease. FXAIX also covers the companies of the S&amp;P 500, but it is a mutual fund. What is the difference between the two? Well there’s not much. The most noticeable one is that mutual funds cannot be traded throughout the day. They can only be purchased at the end of the day. Although not a rule, mutual funds are much more likely to be actively managed than an ETF. Active management means there is a professional portfolio manager in charge of selecting when to buy or sell the things the mutual fund holds. ETFs are much more likely to be passively managed. This means they track a set list of stocks automatically.

#**Conclusion**
These four categories make up a vast majority of investments. Being able to understand how each of them work is crucial in making your own investment choices. Hopefully this post was able to bring up even more questions than it answered if you're new. Now that you know what the major fundamental asset classes are you might ask yourself why you would choose one over the other. This was touched on, but I never went into detail on the risk, return, history, or combination of them. All of these ideas warrant their own posts which may come in the future.

2414,investing,trueconviction,"I will be offering what I hope are a few constructive suggestions for folks looking to grow their money at outsized returns with minimal risk.


There is a catch, of course. These methods involve both labor and are capped by scale. The good news is scale is very high relative to most people's net worth, and labor or time
is a commodity that can be managed and sometimes outsourced.


The most classic example is the intrinsic purchasing power of cash. When you buy in bulk typically your unit price generates savings. The more cash one has on hand, the more they
have the ability to buy a good or service at a historically low price. Every one knows this already, and this isnt very practical because such savings are really only appropriate
when buying necessities. If you are a business that has high cost of goods chances are a great deal of your focus already revolves around savings on consumables.

Every one is also already familiar with the concepts of investing in real estate, education, health, purchasing and learning to operate new tools and hardware, etc. All these things
are great and typically necessitate the cultivation of skill and demand some amout of time, and can be difficult or inconsistent to predict future earnings with. Most importantly,
countless experts who know far more than me about these subjects have already written to great length about these subjects.

What I am offering to suggest here is my primary source of income, namely manufactured spending and account churning.

For account churning, the basic concept is to meet certain thresholds to acquire cash bonuses on new accounts (typically such accounts consist of checking/savings accounts, brokerage
accounts, and sportsbook/gambling accounts). For bank accounts, there is not much strategy to this other than timing your eligibility windows with various instiutions. You will need
to tie up your cash in an account for a certain minimum period of time. If you annualize the lockup period and compare it to the bonus, you will typically realize a rate of return that
is extremely high for the lack of risk. This can be scaled fairly high (many brokerages have bonus tiers extending to the 100k range for new accounts, many banks have bonuses for
deposits up to 20k, and there are hundreds of banks offering bonuses at any given time, and you can repeat this process for each SSN). If you are capable of managing a spreadsheet with a lot of accounts, this is something
you can easily sink low millions into basic account churning. Typically bonuses can be repeated every 2 years, although this will vary greatly among institutions). Be sure to 
prepare to receive a lot of 1099-INTs and 1099-MISC's for your tax year. Some people that are very experienced in account churning will further scale by offering complete account
management to friends to make use of their SSN with their permission and receive a management fee.


Here a couple of tricks and tips: 1. Make use of pre-existing tools and datapoints for tracking eligiblity criteria and opportunities. Some good places to start include
reddit.com/r/churning and doctorofcredit.com 2. For accounts requiring spending activity, buy low volatity products such as T-bills whenever possible. When on gambling sites,
make sure you have a second SSN to simultaneously bet on opposite positions for each account separately. 3. Get very familiar with the regulatory bodies for each account you use
(for example, CFPB, OCC, etc) in case you need to make a complaint or expedite the process of your bonus being awarded.


Credit card bonuses are great and require minimum capital but typically do not scale as high as bank account bonuses. reddit.com/r/churning is a good basic resource for this.
I highly recommend going after them if you understand how to manage your credit score and learn the basics of managing applications to reduce impact to your credit score.


For manufactured spending, the basic concept is to use a rewards generating credit or debit card to purchase a cash-equivalent that can be readily liquidated back to cash at 
a rate whose rewards outweigh any associated transaction costs. For a basic example, consider using an american express blue cash preferred to buy a $500 visa gift card at your local grocer.
(a cash equivalent item). The cash back rate is 6% at a grocery store and the activation fee is 1%, so you are making 5%. You liquidate the visa gift card to another cash equivalent
(such as by making a billpayment, purchasing a money order, reloading a prepaid account, making a debit card deposit to an account, etc). You then transfer this money to your bank account
to pay off your card if you didnt already just make a direct payment on your credit card. You then cycle this as much as you can. 


The annualized ROI for cycling is typically very high. For example, consider cycling an unlimited 2% cash back card such as citi double cash or spark business cash. Let's suppose
your credit limit is 10k. On day 1 of a new cycle you buy 10k of visa gift cards and liquidate in the same day. By day 3 or 4 the charge for your gift card purchases posts to your
account and you now initiate payment. On a seasoned account, payment should typically post within a couple more business days. Suppose payment posts at day 7. This is a complete cycle.
You repeat the cycle 52 times in a year. Your annualized return on your cash is easy to calculate. 10k*0.02*52=10.4k. Suppose you incurred 1% in fees. Your annualized return is 50%
for very little risk. More importantly, this can be scaled and compounded. The cash back earned can be reinvested to cycle which is the compounding part. The scale part comes from
the fact that you can easily obtain large credit limits with strong payment history and that you can prepay certain credit cards such as amex and bofa. So if you have $100M sitting,
amex will happily let you wire $100M from your bank account to them and now your card temporarily has $100M available to spend. This is just one example. There are many ways to 
manufactured spend without gift cards (the liquidation outlets mentioned above such as such as by making a billpayment, purchasing a money order, reloading a prepaid cardaccount,
 making a debit card deposit to an account are often also simultaneously manufactured spending outlets as well).


Another means to scale high at low margins is wholesale reselling. However it is far riskier to resell than it is to buy cash equivalents since you have to trust the creditworthiness of your
buyers and the risk of your items being lost in transit. It is very similar to manufactured spending in the sense that 100% of your revenue can come from cash back without
there being any sort of comission on goods sold. This is precisely also the reason why it scales so well, since costs are externalized from the buyer to the banks to the interchange
fees the banks charge the merchants. The tradeoff is your scale is extraordinarily high (you can easily sink hundreds of millions of dollars into wholesale reselling)
and profit margins are often higher.



I hope this post inspires fellow investors to consider alternatives beyond equities. With a little skill and creativity, you can recreate ROI generating machines whose risk
and consistently you can directly control. If you have ideas and things that work well for you kindly consider sharing your knowledge for others here as well :)",The best investments are hiding in plain site,1633026095

A Wave of Deflation

Cathie Wood: Next Big Risk Is Deflation
The underlying assumption out there is that we’re in an inflationary period turbocharged by supply-chain disruptions. I’ve seen a lot of markets and started in the business during the ’70s. I was in college when inflation was raging. So I know what that is. And I truly believe we’re not going back there and that anyone planning for it is probably going to be making some mistakes.

Instead, we see three major deflationary forces brewing.

On the innovation side, we’re in a period today like we’ve never been in. You have to go back to the telephone, electricity and automobile to see three major technologically enabled sources of innovation evolving at the same time. Today, we have five platforms: DNA sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology — all of which are deflationary.

In artificial intelligence, training costs are dropping by 68% per year. What does that mean? We’re going to see a boom in a lot of products that use AI and therefore are better, cheaper, faster and more creative. 

There’s also DNA sequencing costs. To sequence the first whole human genome, it took $2.7 billion and 13 years of computing power. That was 2003. Eighteen years later, we’re down to $500 and a few hours of computing power. For every cumulative doubling in the number of whole human genomes sequenced, costs drop 40%. 

This is going to transform health care, helping us discern which health-care dollars we’re wasting. And we think more than half of all health-care dollars are wasted today.

Then we have electric vehicles and battery pack system technology. For every cumulative doubling in electric vehicles sold, those costs dropped by 28% for the battery, which means the EV costs are going to be dropping roughly 15% every time we see a doubling in sales and we’re in electric vehicle sales infancy right now. Another is industrial robots. Those costs are also dropping more than 20% for every cumulative doubling.

The good news is that this is good deflation, which causes a boom in economic activity, at least where the innovation is taking place.

The corollary to this is bad deflation. Since the tech and telecom bust and the ’08-’09 financial meltdown, there’s been a significant increase in risk aversion in the market. And so many investors and analysts invest very closely to their benchmarks. They don’t want to stray much.

The problem is this innovation is going to be very disruptive to the traditional world order. So the benchmarks today are constructed based on companies’ past successes. But if disruptive innovation is evolving to such a rapid extent, there’s going to be disintermediation and disruption. Companies that have learned to satisfy short-term shareholders — who want their profits and want them now — have been leveraging up to buy back shares and pay dividends.

Companies haven’t been investing enough in innovation, and we’re going to see a lot of carnage out there increasingly during the next five to 10 years. At the beginning of the S&amp;P 500 indexes initiation, the average lifespan of a company was 100 years. We believe it’s down to a little over 20 years now — but it’s going to collapse going forward.

We’re also seeing some interesting signals in cyclicals. 

Lumber prices shot up last year because of all the remodeling and demand for new homes in suburbs. Prices went to $1,700 and that’s down to $600 now. And a lot of people find that hard to believe because housing still seems so hot. I think it’s a leading indicator that prices probably went a little too far, too fast. 

Consumers feel their purchasing power is going down. Prices of goods and services are moving faster than incomes are increasing. So there’s another reason we’re probably going to see a slowdown. 

But even more important is what has happened with supply chains. If you looked at how businesses were positioned before the coronavirus, they’d been pulling back on inventory building and capital spending for about a year to 18 months. And the reason was the U.S.-China trade war, saber rattling, fear of the conflict blowing up in some way. When the coronavirus hit, businesses that had already been cautious slammed on the brakes. And what did the consumer do? The consumer started — after a month or so with the PPP payments — to stimulate the economy. They started spending because their savings rate in the previous few months had skyrocketed.

Businesses were caught flat-footed, and they’re still caught flat-footed. They haven’t been able to catch up. Inventory liquidation in the second quarter was near record-breaking levels. And so what I believe is happening now is businesses, in order to catch up, have been double- and triple-ordering. That’s what happened with lumber prices and why the decline has been so steep since mid-May. And once they see prices coming down, they’ll pull back on those orders. So I think there could be a big drop in commodity and other prices as the consumer has shifted from consuming goods, which are only a third of consumption to consuming services, just as businesses are scrambling aggressively.

A World of Inequality

Mohamed El-Erian: Inequality Creates Next Big Risk
What worries me the most is inequality, both within and across countries. And it’s something that financial markets puts aside as a social problem, not really an economic or financial problem. And we’ve risked seeing the issue of inequality gather momentum. Covid has already been the great un-equalizer, but rather than go back to where we’ve come from, we are now creating the dynamics for inequality to worsen and to assume greater importance in disrupting all sorts of things in our society.

A highly unequal society is not an economic healthy society. But the thing that worries me even more than that is inequality of opportunity. We know what Covid did to people who had no WiFi at home, who had no computers. We know that public school districts lost touch with a lot of their students and these students were not only becoming unemployed, but unemployable, which means a lost generation of young people.

As we slowly emerge from Covid, its aftermath creates different dynamics around the world. If you’re in a developing country today, you can no longer assume that companies will come to you. The onus is increasingly on you coming to the employer. And that is the real issue when education is lagging, when technology is lagging. So I do worry that we’re going to see this massive process get larger, if we’re not careful.

We were watching a tragic movie in play mode and then Covid came along and pressed fast-forward. First, it worsened wealth inequality because the response to Covid involved massive Federal Reserve liquidity injections to boost asset prices. And who owns assets? It’s the rich. So if you look at what has happened, the top part of the wealth distribution, people are much better off than they were before Covid. But at the bottom end, that hasn’t happened.

Think of people whose jobs have been displaced by this big step toward digitalization, who have no financial assets to begin with and don’t benefit from what has happened to asset prices. In addition, they are hoping to buy a house and they’ve been priced out of the housing market. So suddenly both the actual and potential wealth and income has declined.

To add to that, if they are unemployed, there’s suddenly a skills mismatch. There are record levels of vacancies that the labor market is not able to match to workers. And then you get what economists called multiple equilibria: one bad outcome, resulting not in mean reversion, but a high likelihood of an even worse outcome.

We already know what it looks like because we’ve had a taste of it. On the economic side, it looks like insufficient aggregate demand, which is a fancy way of saying that as the rich capture more income and more wealth, they spend less of it. The poor tend to consume more. So if the incremental income and wealth all go to the rich, then you’re going to have the problem of demand, which means you’re going to have a problem of growth.

And we’ve already had a period of so-called secular stagnation, and what my colleagues and I call the new normal, where we get low and insufficiently inclusive growth. We know what that looks like. We know the social consequences. It is cultural war. It’s alienation. It’s marginalization. That’s not good for society. It eats away at the fabric of society.

We know what it looks like politically. People will become single-issue voters, and single-issue voters can be captured by all sorts of things. No wonder we’re seeing an increase in populism across the world. And then it means a less equal world. You know, I grew up interested in developing countries, and for decades it was almost an accepted fact — not a hypothesis, almost an accepted fact — that these countries would converge to the advanced economies.

Well guess what? We’re having divergence going on right now. And I suspect this divergence is not short term. So we may live in a less equal world, or to be more blunt, a much more unequal world. And that’s problematic for global economic policy coordination, interdependency, immigration. I mean, I can go on and on. So it is problematic. We’ve had a taste of it and we don’t quite like that taste, but it could become a lot worse.

The American dream is all about capturing these amazing opportunities and being able to go right up the income ladder. There’s a correct notion that inequality can incentivize people to work harder, to do better, but there comes a point when it goes from encouraging people to do good things to actually detracting from not just economic well-being, but social and political well-being.

I don’t think the American dream is dead. I think it’s harder to achieve. If you don’t have the right education to begin with, if you don’t have a set of assets to begin with, you’re looking at a much steeper curve, and that is a real problem for too many people.

The prescription is investing in human and physical infrastructure. It’s about enabling people to do more and to do better. It’s about providing people with transformational opportunities. It starts at a very early age, at pre-K, exposing bright minds to exciting education and opportunities. It continues throughout the middle school, high school, university, making elite universities more accessible to people who deserve to be there but may be held back because they come from the wrong zip code or because their parents have never had an education.

There’s a lot that can be done. It’s about fundamentally asking the question, ‘How do we enable our resources, human and physical, to be more inclusive and more productive?’

Hackers on the Loose

SCOTT MINERD

Scott Minerd: Unprotected Financial Network Is Next Big Risk
The No. 1 one risk is the sustainability of the global payment system. And I choose the word sustainability over the word vulnerability, because the real key here is keeping the global payment system running, and we’ve had so many hacks, terrorist attacks, the Colonial Pipeline incident. It would appear that we are extremely vulnerable to having an attack against the payment system of the financial markets — and not just here in the U.S., but in Europe.

What I’m talking about is things like the Fedwire, where the banks’ money clears through. But also something like the DTCC, SWIFT, Euroclear. I mean, I can just keep going on and on and on. And if there was a synchronized attack, we would essentially bring the global financial market to its knees. The first response would probably be that securities prices would crash, and the second is we would probably have to close all the exchanges in the world in order to figure out how to restore the global payments system.

The thing that bothers me about the global payment system is, I don’t think anyone’s focused on it. And this really takes a high degree of international cooperation. It takes a real macro look, meaning there needs to be somebody or some group of people looking at how everything interconnects and where the potential vulnerabilities are.

I would put the probability [of it happening] as very high. Certainly well over 50%. I got accused once when talking about this that I’m actually alerting terrorists and other governments on how to attack us. But the likelihood is they’re already thinking about it.

With the Fed, when I speak to them, they don’t really comment on it. And there’s two interpretations to that: They just don’t think it’s that serious, or they believe it’s so serious that they don’t really want to say anything. Just as we found out with the electric grid, one vulnerability is that the system isn’t hardened enough and we need to harden it for security reasons. The payment system is the same sort of thing. Even though the Fedwire has been modernized over time, it’s still built off an infrastructure that’s extremely old.

We need international cooperation to assess the risk and figure out how we can harden the system that exists in the short run and, in the long run, modernize it. Delivery versus payment, which is the standard way that we’ve delivered securities for 100 years, is in an age like ours, kind of ridiculous. There’s no reason why that just can’t be instantaneous.

But that’s going to take a new generation of technology and whether that’s blockchain or whatever, it needs to be modernized. But in the short run, central banks, exchanges and so forth need to take a hard look at their systems, not just their system, but at the interconnectivity of the system and how secure is that connection that’s being made. Not just from the standpoint of it having being disrupted, but since you’re sending information through the ether, what’s the chance that that can be redirected somewhere.

Certainly, the internet’s vulnerable, right? One of the comments I made to people about cyber cryptocurrency in general is: Why do I need to transact through the internet? Why can’t I just text it to you?

There are other ways to transfer things through the ether, right? So for instance, if you look at crypto as an example, the weak link is the fact that it’s linked to the internet. Even if the blockchain was forever and perfect and hardened and you couldn’t steal from it — which is not true — if you pull the internet down, you’re done.

The U.S. government will play a huge part in [creating a new system] just because we are the financial center of the world. However, to quote Winston Churchill, the U.S. government will always do the right thing after it’s exhausted every other option. So, I don’t think they’re going to go there right away. I think that there’ll be a lot of patches.

* In addition to the new capital, the Company along with several Koch Industries subsidiaries are exploring opportunities to accelerate Li-Cycle’s global growth strategies. This includes potentially working with Koch Engineered Solutions (“KES”) which provides engineering, procurement, and construction services, as well as the Optimized Process Designs group (“OPD”), a capability of KES, which provides detailed engineering packages, single point procurement for all equipment and materials, fabrication, and construction services. Li-Cycle and KES are exploring commercial opportunities to support the global deployment of incremental Spoke facilities and to enhance execution and operational readiness for the Company’s Rochester Hub.
* Under the terms of the investment, KSP will purchase a convertible note in the aggregate principal amount of $100 million (the “Note”). The Note will have an initial conversion price of approximately $13.43 per Li-Cycle common share (the “Common Shares”), subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, which price was established based on 125% of the 7-day volume-weighted average price of Li-Cycle’s common shares prior to the date of the Note Purchase Agreement. Li-Cycle will settle its conversion obligations through the delivery of shares of Common Shares. The Note will mature on September 29, 2026 unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Interest on the Note will be payable semi-annually, and Li-Cycle is permitted to pay interest on the Note in cash or payment in-kind (“PIK”), at its election. Interest payments made in cash will be based on an interest rate of LIBOR plus 5.0% per year, and PIK interest payments will be based on an interest rate of LIBOR plus 6.0% per year. Under the terms of the investment, LIBOR has a floor of 1.0% and a cap of 2.0%. In addition, KSP has committed to a standstill agreement and Li-Cycle has granted certain registration rights to KSP. 

 ***Spoke Fabrication*** 

* KES has capabilities to construct, test and ship modular Spoke facilities at various KES construction facilities, including in Texas and Poland

***Spoke Deployment***

* KES, with offices in 54 countries, can support Li-Cycle with the roll-out and ground execution of Spoke facilities globally

***Hub Operational Readiness***

* KES can support Li-Cycle with the development of a tailored operational readiness plan for the Rochester Hub

2586,investing,utradea,"Hey Everyone,

I wanted to share an analysis of why individual investors have an advantage over institutional investors and can beat the market. Would love to hear your feedback and thoughts.

# Introduction

Imagine you’re a new investor who just downloaded a brokerage app. Now image you’re in charge of an actively managed fund with a team of PhDs working for you. Both of these parties are planning on actively managing their portfolios by selecting individual stocks or bonds. Which one is going to generate higher returns? The answer probably seems pretty clear. If there’s any amount of inefficiency in the market worth taking advantage of it’s going to be captured by those with the most resources and the best education, right?

Wrong, which is what makes the stock market great. There are five key advantages individuals have compared to intuitional investors and passive funds.

1. *Individual investors won’t be fired after a few bad quarters*
2. *Access to information has never been greater, and is free in most cases*
3. *As an individual investor, time is on your side*
4. *Smaller account sizes provide more freedom*
5. *Individual investors can take greater risks*

We will dive into this in more detail, but first let’s look at a bit of history.

Advocates of passive index investing are quick to point out that passive funds have beaten active funds 86% of the time over the past 20 years \[1\]. Between 1991 and 1996 it was a tossup with active funds winning three years and losing three others \[2\]. That time frame was chosen so that we can have a fair comparison later on. In more recent memory, passive funds have won every year since 2013 with no signs of letting up. People quickly conclude that if actively managed funds with teams of PhDs can’t outperform a market index consistently that it must be nearly impossible for a retail investor to do so. This comparison sounds pretty logical on the surface but doesn’t look into the differences between the two groups.

**Retail investors can skip the management fees, can’t be fired for underperforming, are able to invest in a wider range of companies, and can take on as much risk as they want.**

Armed with these advantages retail investors outperformed market weighted index funds 49% of the time before fees from 1991 to 1996, almost the exact same rate as the active funds \[3\]. If you include fees that number drops to 43%. However, many modern brokerages no longer have fees to place orders. Both sides have advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other. This race is a lot closer than most people think.

# Individual Investors Aren’t Fired for A few Bad Quarters

If you’re a fund manager who decides to go a little outside of the box and ends up buying a lot of stocks that aren’t part of the S&amp;P 500 you could run into an issue. Let’s say those stocks you picked ended up doing really poorly this year while the S&amp;P did fine. Managing this fund is your job. If you don’t do well you could be removed from your position. Maybe they let one bad year slide, but could you underperform your peers for two years? How about three? At some point you’re going to get fired. The retail investor could underperform for a decade and still come out on top. The market is very cyclical and some popular and reliable strategies just don’t work for years at a time. Take value investing during the last decade as an example. The market has been dominated by highly valued growth stocks. Even if you carefully selected strong value stocks you would probably not be above the S&amp;P 500 during this period. Despite this, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by an average of 4.54% per year since 1928 \[4\].

# Information has Been Democratized – Institutions are Still Paying

When you have a team of PhDs working for you to help select your stocks you have to pay them. You also need to pay yourself, pay for the office, and for any other resources you use during the selection process. These costs are going to be passed onto the investors of the fund in the form of management fees.

***These fees often cost between 0.5% and 1% annually \[5\].***

This piece is taken each year whether the fund does well or not. This means that even if the retail investor and the fund held the exact same stocks the retail investor would come out ahead.

# Time is on Your Side

Any active fund is going to be extra aware of their quarterly and annual goals. They’re going to be frequently rebalancing to meet certain requirements whether it be a risk level, an amount of diversification, or a reevaluation of their pick’s financials \[6\].

A retail investor can hold a single stock for 40 years if they believe in the long term future of the business. Let’s say both the retail investor and the fund bought Apple at the same time 20 years ago. Apple has grown an insane amount during this time frame. As one stock outpaces the rest it starts to take up a larger and larger portion of your portfolio.

The fund would likely end up selling some of their shares to bring the size of their Apple holding back in line with the rest. This also lowers their exposure to the tech sector which they would also want to keep at a certain level. The retail investor on the other hand has no such limit. He can buy it and hold it until he retires.

# Size Matters But Individual Investors Can Use it Wisely

The average retail investor is buying thousands of dollars of stock at most. The average fund is buying hundreds of thousands of dollars and often millions. This is important for a few reasons. Thousands of dollars will not have any effect on the price of most stocks whereas a million dollars can move a sizeable company. The more money being invested the more it can push the price. When you are buying tons of shares the price is going to creep upwards as you look for more and more sellers. This means that the more you buy the worse your average entry price will be. The same thing happens when you sell. Unloading millions of dollars in shares is going to drop the price which means you get a poor exit price as well. The retail trader does not have to deal with this and will have better prices on both ends which leads to better performance, even if the same stocks are picked!

The size of the investment doesn’t only affect the prices you get, it also influences what you can even attempt to buy in the first place. Some publicly traded companies have market caps of 50 million or less. It’s just not feasible for huge funds to be buying into these companies. If a fund ever buys so much of a company that it owns 5% it will need to register that with the SEC and is forced to file beneficial own reports \[7\]. The retail trader will never run into this issue.

# Individual Investors Can Use Risk to Their Advantage

We’ve seen a few reasons why funds tend to stick the S&amp;P 500 companies. We’ve also seen that they are surprisingly risk averse. Whether it be buying smaller companies, having a more concentrated portfolio, or making use of derivatives like long term call options, the retail investor has the ability to take on as much risk as they want.

If you’re familiar with the statistics behind optimized betting you’ll know what the Kelly Criterion is. In short, it’s a way to determine the optimal size bet you should take\*\*.\*\*

**The Kelly Criterion says that you should be holding a little more than 200% in the S&amp;P 500 for maximum returns, at least historically \[8\].**

This is a heavily leveraged and high risk account but was able to survive both the Dot Com Bubble and the 2008 Financial Crisis. Despite higher returns in the long term this portfolio underperforms the market for years after each crash. This makes it unrealistic for a fund manager to try to execute, but if you can handle the risk it’s an option available to every retail investor who has a long time horizon.

# Final Thoughts: If Managed Properly, These Advantages Allow Individual Investors to Beat the Market

It’s true that most actively managed funds do not outperform their passive counterparts. This is often used to cast doubt on the performance of retail investors. If the experts can’t outperform, how could you? Well, it turns out there are a lot of differences between billion dollar funds and some guy on his Robinhood app. A surprising amount of these differences offer the retail investor an advantage, or at the very least an additional degree of freedom. Using actively managed funds as a benchmark is incredibly misleading.

The odds are not in your favor as an average stock picking retail investor, but they’re not nearly as bad as they’re usually portrayed\*\*.\*\*

**In the same 1991-1996 study 25% of retail investors outperformed the index by 6% or more annually.**

If you dedicate the time and have good emotional control you can capitalize on these advantages most people don’t even know they have.

\----

TLDR; The individual investors has a number of advantages over institutional investors and can beat the market

2612,investing,Connorvo,"I scraped every new performance grant CEOs received in 2017 to see if copying those trades would beat the market. The initial results are very promising (12-25% ɑlpha on average depending on the timeframe), but more research needs to be done!

# How it works:

I wrote a python script that scraped every single Form 4 filed in 2017. It was only looking for filings that matched the below criteria:

1. The grant was a Performance Grant. Performance Grants are used to reward executives with stock only if they reach certain performance targets
2. The Performance Grant targets were for the stock to reach specified price targets. This means that the executive would receive stock ***only*** if the stock hit certain price targets during the given timeframe
3. The executive receiving the grant was a CEO or President.
4. The grant was not regularly scheduled (i.e. it wasn’t a grant they would receive every year). FIltering these out makes it more likely that the grant was given because the CEO and Board of Directors have confidence that the stock can reach the price targets.

# Overall Results

These kinds of grants don’t happen very often, there were only 9 of them in 2017, but they did indeed beat the market.

Of the 9 stocks that were found, all of them peaked at a price more than 35% above the performance grant and 6 of them peaked up more than 100% in the 3 years following the grant.

The below table is the average returns by months since the performance grant for the SPY and the stocks I found.

Taking a slightly closer look at “Max Returns” in the table below, we can see it took anywhere from 141 days to 1088 days for the stocks to reach their max return since the grant. The average was \~700 days, meaning it takes about 2 years for most of the stocks to hit their peak.

You will also see that 6 of the 9 stocks reached their performance grant targets. 2 of the 3 stocks that didn’t reach their targets had insanely high targets of 160% and 260% stock returns and both of the stocks had well over 100% returns. The other target that wasn’t reached had a 58% target but was the worst-performing stock

This grant only had one vesting date, February 6, 2020, but the grant would vest if it hit the price targets at any point between the grant date and February 6, 2020. The stock had vesting targets at $11, $14, and $18. The stock fell about 14% over the next 2.5 months before then popping up to $10.20 (37% return) about 5 months after the grant date. The stock then had a looooong fall for the next \~1.5 years until February 6, 2020. The stock recovered and reached all the way up to $15 after COVID, but the performance grant had already expired so they never received any of the awards.

The grant could begin vesting immediately and they had 2.5 years to reach the goal. The stock price immediately started going up after the performance grant and reached a local maximum of $10.55 (85% return) 4 months after the initial grant before spending the next year and a half going down to below $7. This grant was an all-or-nothing grant where the price had to reach $16 within 2.5 years to vest. It never reached that goal but maxed out at $12.53 (120% return) about 2 years after the initial grant.

These grants could start paying out immediately upon hitting the $15 target and they had until the end of 2020 to hit that goal. Unlike most grants, they only gave an all-or-nothing $15 price target instead of tiered price targets that start out easier to hit. They never quite got to the $15 price target but did cross $13 (almost a 200% return) right around the 1-year mark.

# FAQs / Concerncs

***What is a Form 4?***

A Form 4 is filed any time an executive at a public company buys, sells, or is granted stock. They are required to file with the SEC within 3 days of taking the action

***Why did you pick 2017?***

Most performance grants have a timeline that is 3 years or shorter (though some are up to 5 years). 2017 ensures enough time has passed for the grant to actually play out

***Where did you get the data?***

The SEC has a database (EDGAR) that lets you scrape all of the info from all of the SEC filings

***Why did you pick the timeframes you chose (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months)?***

No particular rhyme or reason. I felt like these gave a pretty good overview of the short, medium, and long-term returns for each grant.

***9 stocks aren’t very many***

True. The sample size is very small. I am in the process of doing the analysis for more years to increase this number, but the number will never get very large as these types of grants don't happen super often.

**This isn't adjusted for risk in any way**

This is also true. These stocks vary from small to large market cap and have different levels of volatility which can affect the returns on a risk-adjusted basis. It may be worth diving into risk adjustments at some point, but right now I want to focus on gathering more data and seeing if there are any potentially viable investment strategies around the data.

# Takeaways

I definitely think this is promising, but the hard part is putting it into action. Obviously, if we could see the future and sell at the max price for all of the stocks, we’d all make millions, but the stocks don’t all just go up and to the right.

Some of them fall before popping, some pop and then fall, some pop then fall then pop even more.

There is potentially a viable strategy involving holding the stocks until they reach some return threshold (maybe like 25%) and then letting it run with a stop-loss, but I think I need more data to build better strategies. I will work on gathering more data.",Can you beat the market by copying CEO Performance Grants? It looks like you might!,1632846860
2616,investing,elemental333,"Hi everyone...so a few weeks ago I bought shares of a stock at an ATH and have been averaging my cost basis down in an attempt to still come out ahead. During another run up, I sold all of my shares of this stock (most for profit, but some for a slight loss) and overall made some decent money.

This stock just dipped and I went to buy more...however, I lost track of the exact number of days it had been since I sold some shares at a loss, so I got hit with the wash sale rule. I am now down A LOT on this stock due to my cost basis being almost double the share price. 

This is my first major mistake since I began actively trading earlier in the year and I'm trying to recoup as much of my gains as possible. Is there anything I can do about this or do I just have to take the loss and live and learn?

I moved multiple tens of thousands of dollars in IRA money over to Vanguard from another company, with explicit instructions to the advisor team that the money be reinvested according to the agreed-upon asset allocation — in my case, about 60-65 percent exposure to U.S. stocks. Instead, the dumbasses let the sum sit and sit...in a money market account. It made exactly *nothing*. I didn't find out about that until very recently. Cost me thousands.

I had other complaints about Vanguard (talking to anybody on the advisor team required reserving a time slot literally *weeks* in advance, which is *worse* service than I got *before* I signed up for Personal Advisor). The mistake with the money transfer/reinvestment finally clinched it. I canceled the agreement, and am on my own again.

2627,investing,thecrazednutter,"I am starting to think that gold is no longer a suitable inflation hedge. We are experiencing the most inflation in over 30 years right now and gold is not budging. In fact, gold is approaching pre-pandemic prices. Furthermore, real interest rates, which are interest rates that take inflation into account, are among the lowest they've been in 50 years. They were higher in the mid-70s and early-80s. Gold is not rising and maybe it is because it is a) not fashionable and b) no longer suitable for this era.

However, if inflation persists gold could still rebound. In the event of continued or above trend inflation, investor's will feel a need to find a store of value. Large institutional investors have a duty to preserve their clients' investments. They will buy anything that holds value, even if it doesn't rise much.

Yet, we go out of our ways to select certain brands over others - most of the time at a higher price \[1\]. Everyone knows the importance of reputation for a company. Highly reputable brands have multiple things going for them:

* Their customers are extremely loyal and drive recurring purchases
* The public is vocal about recommending their brand and products
* Easier to expand to other markets as their reputation precedes them

Basically, you can consider having a great reputation to be a positive feedback loop on steroids! In an economy where 70-80% of the market value of a company comes from intangible assets like brand equity, intellectual capital, and goodwill \[2\], reputations can make or break a company’s performance.

In one of my previous analyses, we had discovered and proved that the [best companies to work for routinely beat the market in stock returns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/). So this week, let’s see how the most reputed brands have performed over the last decade!
___
**Data**

While there are multiple companies that measure reputation, I chose the [RepTrack](https://www.reptrak.com/) list for my analysis as they seem to be the most established ones and have been creating their top 100 list for the last 2 decades.

They base their study on more than 240K responders over 15+ countries and the rating tells us how the companies are regarded by the general public. They have multiple factors that go into the final ranking, but for this analysis, I am only considering the final rank of the company.

I am considering the companies that were present in the Top 10 list at least once in the last decade \[2012 - 2021\] 
___
**Analysis**

RepTrack publishes their result in March, every year. Since I could not find any fixed date of publication, for the purpose of the stock price calculation, I am using April 1st of every year as my investment date.

Even though the company produces a Top 100 list, I have limited my analysis to the Top 10 companies \[3\]. We then calculate the stock returns generated by these companies \[4\] over various time periods (1-year, 3-years, 5-years &amp; till date) and then compare it to our benchmark. \[5\]
___
 **Results** 

**Return Comparison - SPY vs Top 10 - Most Reputable Brands** 

|Time Period|Most Reputable Brand (Avg Return)|SPY (Avg Return)|Alpha|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 Year|17.1%|16.2%|0.9%|
|3 Years|44.8%|41.2%|3.6%|
|5 Years|94.1%|77.9%|16.2%|
|Till Date|188.3%|136.4%|51.9%|

 

Companies in the most reputable list have consistently beaten SPY over different time periods. There is a significant improvement in overall return when holding the investment for a longer-term.

My hypothesis here is that, even though the short-term returns can be affected by market cycles, over the long run, companies having a great reputation end up outperforming their peers, and this is reflected in their stock price.

[Another interesting insight](https://preview.redd.it/shv1yw10q8q71.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b85dbf0596b22f9d93bfa3f1cd954f012e9e796) we can derive from the data is the performance of the top-10 companies in each year’s list. As we can see, the most reputable brands beat SPY by a considerable margin in 7/10 years \[6\]. 
___
**Limitations to the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.

* Ideally, the backtest should be done over 30-40 year’s worth of data as we would know how the changing trends would impact the analysis. The last decade or so was predominantly biased towards tech.
* One should also benchmark this against the companies having an average or poor reputation to see if reputation is indeed a distinguishing factor that is driving the returns. \[7\]
* Finally, reputation is just one factor related to the company. There are companies whose reputations are in the gutter but have produced extraordinary returns for their shareholders (Facebook gave 175% return &amp; Volkswagen gave 117% return in the last 5 years even after all the scandals they have been through). 
___
**Conclusion**

Whether you like it or not, brands seem to have a significant impact on our daily lives. Just think about the number of times you/your friend have sworn by a brand and recommended it to everyone \[8\]. Almost all the brands in the top 10 list (eg. Rolex, Ferrari, Adidas, Harley-Davidson) have users that are extremely loyal, willing to pay a premium, and acts as unofficial spokespersons for the company.

Our analysis, in turn, proves that all these positive factors cause the company to outperform the market! So now you know what to do next time when your friend is swearing by a brand.

Until next week…

\[3\] The main reason for stopping with the Top 10 is the manual data pull process. They do not give a stock ticker associated with the stock nor is the list easily parsable. Given we are pulling data for 10 years, I limited myself to the top 10 companies.

\[4\] A stock is only considered if it’s directly investable from the US market and is an independent company (Examples of companies ignored - Rolex, LEGO Group, and Bosch)

\[5\] Before you come at me with Pitchforks for using S&amp;P 500 instead of Nasdaq Composite, please take a look at the list of companies. It’s from a wide variety of industries. Adding to this, even though tech provided the majority of returns, starting in 2012, you would not have any idea about the tech run we would be having over the next decade.

\[6\] I don’t think 2020 and 2021 should be counted here due to two reasons. First, it’s not enough time as we can see from the first graph (there is very little difference in performance over 1 year period), and secondly, 2020 was one of the largest bull runs in the history of SPY.

2739,investing,scarberia123,"Panic selling is common after stock market dips, and it’s more likely to happen with certain investors, according to research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

When the market drops, men who are over age 45, or are married with children or have self-described “excellent investment experience” are more prone to sell-offs, the research shows. 

“These are significant drivers of panic selling,” said co-author Chi Heem Wong, researcher at MIT. And many who leave the stock market don’t return, thereby missing out on recoveries.

While the study doesn’t uncover why some investors may be more vulnerable to emotional selling, financial experts say the findings raise further questions about how these factors — gender, age, marriage and family — affect behavior.

The research suggests these sellers have emotional overreactions defined by their decisions having the opposite of the intended effect, said Amanda Clayman, a financial therapist in Los Angeles. 

“Clearly, these are people who are trying to protect themselves,” she said.

While most investors are vulnerable to emotional choices, the findings from MIT align with other research showing men may be more prone to acting on their impulses. 

“Women are not as likely to take a huge decisive action like this because they’re not quite sure that their impulse or their feeling is correct,” Clayman said.

Men are 35% more likely to trade investments than women, according to a study from Fidelity, and trying to time the market often leads to lower performance. 

Moreover, those trading to achieve stability during volatile periods often see the opposite results, another study from the University of British Columbia finds. 

Control bias
Some males face pressure from an early age to “figure it out themselves,” which may trigger a control bias, or thinking that can influence results when they can not, said certified financial planner Teresa Bailey, wealth strategist at Waddell &amp; Associates in Nashville, Tennessee.  

“They sometimes feel that if they know enough about a subject, they should be able to control the outcome,” she said. “Unfortunately, there are far more variables at play when attempting to time the market.”

And once these investors get lost, it can be tough to seek guidance if they feel it’s their role to solve the problem on their own, she said.

Checks and balances
As humans primed with survival instincts, it can be challenging to avoid “fight or flight” responses like hitting the sell button when stocks plummet, Clayman said.

However, someone possibly more susceptible to panic selling may want to create a system of checks and balances, such as calling a peer or discussing the decision with a partner, she said, to protect themselves from emotional responses.

“We are not very accurate at assessing our actual threat response when we think about it ahead of time,” Clayman said. “Most of us freak out way more than we think.”

2754,investing,informedFinancials,"&gt; Despite standard investment advice to the contrary, individuals often engage in panic selling, liquidating significant portions of their risky assets in response to large losses.Using a novel dataset of 653,455 individual brokerage accounts belonging to 298,556 households, we document the frequency, timing, and duration of panic sales, which wedefine as a decline of 90% of a household account’s equity assets over the course of onemonth, of which 50% or more is due to trades. We find that a disproportionate numberof households make panic sales when there are sharp market downturns, a phenomenonwe call ‘freaking out’. We show that panic selling and freakouts are predictable andfundamentally different from other well-known behavioral patterns such as overtradingor the disposition effect. Investors who are male, or above the age of 45, or married, orhave more dependents, or who self-identify as having excellent investment experience orknowledge tend to freak out with greater frequency. We use a five-layer neural networkmodel to predict freakout events one month in advance, given recent market conditionsand an investor’s demographic attributes and financial history, which exhibited truenegative and positive accuracy rates of 81.5% and 69.5%, respectively, in an out-of-sample test set. We measure the opportunity of cost of panic sales and find that, whilefreaking out does protect investors during a crisis, such investors often wait too longto reinvest, causing them to miss out on significant profits when markets rebound.

The good times are almost up. 

Here's a long wall of text, don't apologise for it, no TLDR. Don't expect anyone to read this anyway.

--- **Everything depends on treasury bonds and inflation** ---

Don't look at the S&amp;P as a PE ratio, but as a yield, so it's 1:1 with bonds. For example the S&amp;P 500 has a 34.75 PE - in earnings yield 2.9% a year. The ratio between treasuries and the S&amp;P 500 is called BEER (bond equity earnings yield ratio). 

Currently a 10 year US treasury yields 1.4% and S&amp;P 2.9%. The yield on a treasury can't exceed stocks in the long run, who would buy stocks if they could do better in risk free bonds. S&amp;P comes with risk premium due to downturns. 

Treasury yield are near all-time lows due to a number of factors including COVID and the fed printing $120b/month to buy securities. Low treasury yields make S&amp;P look more attractive, driving up the price and down the yield. 2.9% is better then 1.4%.

This relationship between treasuries, inflation and stock yields determines *everything.*

Money supply has expanded rapidly due to massive printing. M1 massively, M2 slightly so far. As the velocity of money increases with reopening it guarantees M2 expansion.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL

Wages are up, commodity prices are up which in conjunction with massive money printing *guarantees* inflation will at the very least run hotter then it was pre-2020 for an extended period of time. How hot... who knows? In 2019 it was 1.8%, so at a minimum we're looking at 2%, probably higher. Not hyper-inflation but hotter then before. This is a certainty. 

--- **The debt burden** ---

The government funds itself with treasuries and so the yield it has to pay is a major deal. The US has $29t in debt, at a 1.4% yield that's $400b/year in interest payments. Manageable. At 14%, as it was in the 80s, that's $4t a year, almost as much as the entire yearly $6.5t budget. Unmanageable. 

This massive debt expansion gives very little room for the fed to manoeuvre, which makes it very predictable. The fed *cannot* allow inflation run too hot as it would bankrupt America. 

Given a choice between crashing the market and inflation it will crash the market. It does not have the option to do anything else, it cannot let yields rise significantly. 

--- **So what does this mean for stocks?** ---

Remember: Inflation rate &lt; Treasury yields &lt; S&amp;P yields

PE ratios going up over last 30 years is not the result of investors randomly deciding stocks are worth more. It's the result of low inflation, therefore low treasury yields, therefore low S&amp;P yields, therefore PE going up, therefore stocks going up. 

The US economy in real terms has been barely growing, a couple percent a year at best, the massive bull run over the last decade is not a sign of economic prosperity, it's almost purely multiple expansion. We're at one end of the pendulum and now it has to swing back.  

Inflation guaranteed to go up = treasury yields guaranteed to go up = S&amp;P yield guaranteed to go up (PE ratio going down). 

The yield on a treasury can't trail inflation significantly and historically has sat above inflation. There are less buyers for something guaranteed to lose purchasing power every year. 

That means if inflation sits at 2.5% we're looking at treasury yields at a minimum of 3-4%. Which means S&amp;P yield (currently 2.9%) has to sit up around 5-6%. This would involve the S&amp;P losing *half* its value from relatively small absolute changes to inflation. 

Even the fed estimates inflation to be 4% in 2021 and 2% going forward which will be the absolute best case scenario. 2% inflation would still cause at least a 20% drop in stocks, probably much more.

--- **Conclusion** ---

Inflation running hotter is a mathematic certainty. Treasury yields going up is a mathematic certainty. S&amp;P PE ratio (and therefore stock price) coming down is a mathematic certainty. 

The fed can choose to either fight inflation and crash the market, or let inflation run free and support the market. It will mostly choose the former, however we will see a bit of both. Inflation will run hotter then expected and stocks will fall.

The market won't crash all at once bar some unforeseeable event, this won't happen overnight, it will gradually wheeze down as treasury yields adjust to the asset purchase taper and inflation ticking up. I am naming the upcoming event **""The Great Wheeze""** and I expect everybody to call it this.

The underlying economy will keep ticking along relatively normal as before, so barely growing in real terms, but stocks will spend years in decline as treasury yields rise. People will recommend 60/40 stock/bond portfolios again. If you are looking to work in investment banks ask to join the bond division. 

I predict this will start within 12 months, probably accelerate early-mid next year and continue. 

--- **Is there a way to make money from this?** ---

The problem with everything bubbles is there's less opportunity. Almost everyone is going to take a hit.

Diversify away from US stocks, invest in low PE foreign markets with high underlying growth to counteract PE compression. Economies that aren't to dependant on exporting to the US is best. We're at the cusp of a new era in investment that will be defined by international markets. Commodity and defensive value stocks with decent dividends are probably solid.

The other option is to hedge with 20-40% of your portfolio. Hedge against treasury yields going up (hello Burry) and the market going down. Goofy valuation stocks will fall the most. The problem is the market can stay irrational for extended periods of time.

Holding cash is ok, but inflation will start to eat into its purchasing power. There's not going to be a sudden dip and then rebound, it will wheeze out for years, as it's not caused by some temporary recoverable event like COVID or the GFC, it's caused by the economic equivalent of gravity.  

The other option is markets don't collapse in uniform. Typically there's a cascade of collapse that starts at fringe markets and heads inwards towards the core. If you're holding stocks pre-collapse, selling them and buying in sectors that have already collapsed is another play.

Best of luck fellas, catch you on the other side.",The Great Market Wheeze is almost upon us,1632793845

2828,investing,bestzec,"Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Generics…

Wait no, the company debt

Wait actually, the opioid lawsuits

Okay there is a room full of elephants and we’re over the weight limit so let’s let them out one at a time.

**Generics:**

As everyone and their deceased great grandmother likes to point out, margins for generics are thin. However, fast food margins are thin too but we still get Mickey D’s and Wendy’s all the time and they are doing well. Thin margins may be a barrier to navigate around, but it does not prevent success if the overall market and the company’s market share is big enough. Thin margins is a deterrent for new competition and a barrier to entry for new players in the field and an already established behemoth like TEVA will be that much harder to knock down by a newcomer. Furthermore, unlike the fast food consuming population that die early from heart disease and diabetes, preventing the overall fast food industry from growing as they lose their customers (not to mention (yes I’m mentioning it) the growing trend of eating healthily which helps my next point), the growing aging population need more and more affordable drugs (cough generics) to stay alive and performant in the bedroom. Guess which company has a super good, affordable generic viagra drug… That’s right it’s TEVA.

Viagra is clearly not the only drug I’m on right now. You guessed it, the other one is adderall, a shit ton of it. I’m popping them like tic tacs. And it’s the TEVA brand of course. As more and more people have a harder time focusing due to navigating the stresses and distractions of life in a pandemic, while competition at every aspect of life (school, work, sex life) is at an all time high, they are diagnosed with ADHD and will need generic adderall that they can afford. Theres also a more recent booming emergence for needing copious amounts of adderall as new, unexperienced traders join the stock and crypto markets to invest and lose all their money and stare at charts all day, which requires focus for a solid 8-9 hours and can only be done by means of taking a lot of adderall.

Did I mention the stress that comes from all these aspects of life? Because TEVA has a Xanax generic to help with that too. I’ll be taking that later when I’m ready to go to sleep.

Medically licensed pill prescribers are in on this too. They are raking in the dough. Just ask my psychiatrist. A 5 minute phone conversation on a monthly basis is all I need to replenish all of my prescriptions. No medical checks or anything like that needed either based on my experience. He gets paid over $500 through insurance for these 5 minute interactions. It is easy to find pill pushers to provide the licensed drugs we all know and love, and need.

Oh and if you’re not sold on that, then maybe some medical weed will help lower your guard. If you have cancer or some other disease, TEVA can provide you with some generically licensed weed to ease your pain. But bestzec, isn’t weed becoming legalized everywhere? Maybe, but it’s a slow process, and it can still take years for most states and countries to legalize it. Furthermore, even if it was legal everywhere, there are a few important things to consider. It is expensive as shit in states that legalized it. I’m talking $100s of dollars for a few edibles that may last for only a few days. They already make it expensive to begin with and then tax the shit out of it for good measure. Good luck getting enough supply for your daily needs without going bankrupt. Also, many of these dispensaries and the weed that they sell are not FDA approved and is made by unlicensed or inconsistent producers. If I’m paying $100s of dollars that weed better be good and better work. I don’t want some unmixed batch where half my chocolates are only good for cavities and the other half puts me in the hospital. If I can get a pill pusher to prescribe me some regulated weed that I know is consistent, healthy, FDA approved and has insurance covering the cost, then I would much rather do that than going bankrupt and ending up in the hospital.

Generics sales are expected to grow over 25% (With everything mentioned earlier, I expect a much higher revenue growth than 25%, but maybe that’s just from my own consumption) over the next 5 years and TEVA is one of only a few big sellers in this field. This translates to increases in billions of revenues for TEVA as a large portion of TEVA’s revenues comes from generics.

**The company debt:**

Teva has a lot of debt. Like a lot. Even more than I have in the bank. However, looking at their debt chart, they have been reducing it every year since it spiked in 2016. At this rate they can bring it back to the levels of 2015 in about 6 years. Debt is only a problem if the interest is high and you’re not making any money to pay it off, but TEVA’s revenues alone for one year are almost as much as its current debt. Now I know revenues are not profits, but if they reduce some operating expenses (which they have been trimming the fat over the past few years) as well as their generics market keeps growing, they’ll be able to reduce the debt even faster. Lastly, a point about debt in general and why it is not so bad when the interest is low (which it is especially these days). With inflation on the rise and Printer Powell setting his printers on overdrive at an exponential pace for the past few years, printing 40% of the money US has ever had in 2020 alone, covering low interest debt made at historical costs/prices gets easier as value of money is adjusted to today’s prices (This is also a reason why TEVA’s stock price decline for a decade with inflation going haywire is very suspicious). The point is that TEVA is still making a shit ton of money ($17B in 2019) and are managing and reducing their debt.

**Opioid lawsuits:**

There’s been headlines making the news about progress around these lawsuits. The bigger companies like J&amp;J are reaching settlements saying they are prepared to pay around $5 B dollars. So let’s do some ratios. If a giant company like J&amp;J, that’s worth $430 B market cap is prepared to only pay $5 B, then Teva, which is completely undervalued and only worth $10 B, should be settling for around \~ $116 M. Even if it was $0.5 B, it would still just be a drop in the bucket of their revenues and they can cover that in 1 quarter alone. Because TEVA also has debt and a low market cap, they can argue to reduce the settlement cost to a reasonable amount. They are not going to charge $TEVA with a $10 Billion dollar fine when J&amp;J which is 43 times bigger is settling for only $5 Billion.

Are there any elephants left? I’m sure there are, there always are. Or maybe the ones mentioned are still in the room. So go ahead and bring them up in the comments.

**Onwards to the valuation:**

What’s valuable? Getting into undervalued assets; not accurately valued or overvalued assets that are at or around all time high prices.

You think i’m going to suggest buying something at all time high price? hell no. Even if it is accurately valued. Not interested. Amazon at 2 Trillion dollars? Apple at 2 Trillion? FB at 1 Trillion? Any other S&amp;P 100 stock? No thanks (I know most of you probably have some of these stocks. I am not saying they should go down in value, just that at Trillions of dollars market cap maybe they are at the very least accurately valued? And less likely to 2x-5x in price in the next few years which would bring some of them to 10 Trillion dollars market cap if they do. Not to mention (again mentioning) their leadership unloading Billions of dollars in shares on current buyers. Not interested in being Bezos’s ex-wife’s bagholder as she dumps her billions, along with Bezos himself, at all time high on the vulnerable retail market).

Now looking at the price graph over the past couple decades, it’s more than likely that if you bought and held TEVA then you’re in the red. Even the one true Buffett is in the red based on when he bought his TEVAs. But have no fear Mr. Buffett, I’m coming back for you.

What I like about TEVA is that I think it is grossly undervalued based on its current and historical price and compared to other pharma companies valuations. It looks like it has been oversold for some time and this is the accumulation period. Buying it now is pretty much buying it at an all time low as it is clearly at a period of accumulation at the $8-$10 range in the past couple years. Buyers have an opportunity to get shares at a cost that people had 20 years ago, all while inflation has been rampantly ravaging the dollar. I’ve been DCAing for some time to bring my cost basis way down.

**A few finishing notes to depart with:**

Teva has also been revamping their leadership. The current CEO is a family man from Denmark and everyone likes Denmark.

There is also a lot of price manipulation happening behind the scenes. The hedge funds have strong control of the stock price so be careful of buying options and holding your call options that expire on Fridays when the price is close to a strike price. They always bring it below so the options expire worthless. They’ve been preventing breakouts upwards for some time during this accumulation period but I doubt they will hold it much longer as more and more people are accumulating.

Lastly, looking at the trend of Institutional Ownership and Shareholders that filed forms with the SEC (fintel) over the past 7 years it looks very promising as almost all the shares are now being held strong and there will be a share shortage soon for people trying to get in cheap as TEVA recovers. That’s right, this is not a short squeeze play, at least not yet. There is a lot of institutional owners, many of which are in the red, and no one wants to sell at a loss so most of them probably want to hold till at least $20. If they’ve been holding for this long, and even accumulating more, then they’ll keep holding for the price recovery.

Right now today a BRAND NEW Tesla Model 3 is about the cheapest car on the road to own.    Sounds crazy, most people still see Tesla as a rich kids toy but i've looked at all the numbers, battery degradation, overall cost, resale, etc  and a new Tesla is a really wise investment for most people.   


If they redo the EV tax credit (US taxpayers) it becomes a no brainer.   


Question is, when will most people realize this?  


Unlike ICE cars and most other durable goods, EV's have a huge margin for continued cost reduction.  They will keep getting better and cheaper.   


Likewise, once the commercial truck makers break the 650 mile barrier, that sector will flip overnight.    


Going forward as an investor I want to be neck deep in batteries, charging systems, mining and the actual cars.    For now Tesla and Rivian are about the only EV only players and the other car makers are wrapped around their ICE legacy products but i'll be looking at the ones who have the best product and are dumping ICE the quickest.

I say this so readers are not alarmed that I am picking individual stocks as someone who has only a few years of investing experience.

As a retail investor, one thing I am confused about are stock splits (e.g., Zillow splitting into Z and ZG or Google splitting into GOOG and GOOGL). I understand that companies do this in order to create new classes of shares that can serve a variety of purposes, like allowing the company to make acquisitions, compensate executives, etc.

My question is: does it matter which version of the stock I buy? For example, if I wanted to buy stock in Zillow, is buying Z essentially the same thing as buying ZG, even if one is cheaper than the other? Will they go up or down similarly? Is there anything else I need to know about stock splits?

„Nike reports earnings tonight for their first financial quarter of 2022 (covering the months June-August 2021). The consensus revenue estimate calls for 12.54bn in revenue (1.6% q-o-q increase), with the highest estimate pegged at 12.9bn in revenue (4.6% q-o-q increase). Estimates call for EPS of 1.12, which has recently been revised downward slightly as people are worried about supply chain issues in Vietnam (more on that later).

Nike's brand strength and pricing power is unparalleled among retailers, and I think they will outdo the revenue expectations and see a decent upwards bump in price. Store reopenings in Europe and coastal USA should work in their favor this quarter, while they still benefit from tremendously strong digital channels.

**Store visits**

While May and June were comparatively weak, according to this data Nike did very well in July and August to make up for it. They outperformed especially in New York and California, while being approximately on par with Lulu in Texas and Florida. According to Linkedin, they have also increased their sales personnel by 3% over the past 6 months.

**Website visits**

Nike has also seen a nice uptick in website hits in recent months. According to Similarweb, their website had a total of 361.5 million from June-August, compared to 330 million in the previous 3 months, for a 10% increase 

**Risks**

This is probably one of the riskier plays I’ve posted here since expectations for Nike are actually quite high. The main reason I’m even posting it is that they dropped quite a lot in the past weeks and it’s looking oversold, and the overall market looks strong right now. Don’t bet the house on this one.

Nike had fantastic earnings and a huge jump 3 months ago, and is now trading a couple percent above that level. It's somewhat uncommon (but not unheard of) for stocks to have 2 big jumps after consecutive earnings reports.

The Put-call open interest ratio is skewed towards put, which indicates people are generally bullish. This play more or less goes along with the consensus view, which isn’t always the right move.

Supply chain issues might be worse than I estimate. Even if they aren’t, Nike might decide to lowball guidance to play it safe. I'm not Vietnamese, don't read Vietnamese, and don't know anyone in Vietnam. I have no idea how bad the supply chain issue will be - I am simply making an educated guess based on publicly available English-language sources.“",NIKE - earnings report and my opinion,1632439014

Read in full here - [arXiv:cond-mat/9903321v3 8 Jun 1999](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9903321.pdf)

**Introduction**

Two recent papers \[Johansen and Sornette, 1999a, Johansen et al., 2000\] have presented increasing evidence on the Oct. 1929, Oct. 1987, Hong-Kong Oct. 1987 crashes, on the Aug. 1998 global market events and on the 1985 Forex event on the US dollar, for the following hypothesis \[Sornette et al, 1996\] describing stock market crashes : we propose that they are caused by a slow build-up of long-range time correlations reflecting those between traders leading to a collapse of the stock market in one critical instant.

This build-up manifest itself as an over-all power law acceleration in the price decorated by “log-periodic” precursors. Here, “log-periodicity” refers to a sequence of oscillations with progressively shorter cycles of a period decaying according to a geometrical series.

In addition, extensive statistical tests have been performed \[Johansen et al., 2000, Johansen, 1997\] to show that the reported “logperiodic” structures essentially never occurred in ≈ 105 years of synthetic trading following a “classical” time-series model, the GARCH(1,1) model with student-t statistics, often used as a benchmark in academic circles as well as by practitioners. Thus, the null hypothesis that log-periodicity could result simply from random fluctuations is strongly rejected

**Conclusion**

We have presented a synthesis of the available empirical evidence in the light of recent theoretical developments for the existence of characteristic log-periodic signatures of growing bubbles in a variety of stock markets as well as currencies.

We have here documented 8 unrelated crashes from 1929 to 1998, on stock markets as diverse as the US, Hong-Kong or the Russian market and on currencies.

In addition, we have discovered a significant bubble on Wall Street ending in 1962 \[Johansen et al., 2000\] as well as “anti-bubbles”on the Nikkei since 1990 and the Gold (after the 1980 bubble maximum) \[Johansen and Sornette, 1999c\].

Quite unexpectedly, we have shown that the Russian bubble crashing 14 in Aug. 1997 had close to identical power law and log-periodic behaviour to the bubbles observed on Wall Street, the Hong-Kong stock market and on currencies.

To our knowledge, no major financial crash preceded by an extended bubble has occurred in the past 2 decades without exhibit a logperiodic signature.

In this context, note that the novel analysis of the Russian index presented here was motivated by Ilinski’s claim of a crash without log-periodic signature, which we have shown to be incorrect.

All these results, taken together with the remarkable robustness and consistency of the estimation of the exponent β as well as the more important statistics the scaling ratio λ, make the case for power law acceleration and log-periodicity very strong.

In our opinion, one can no more ignore these very specific and strong signatures which is characteristic of developing bubbles and this calls for further investigations to unravel in more depths the underlying economical, financial and behavioural mechanisms.

These different cases, together with the 1962 “slow event” as well as the “anti-bubbles”, show that the log-periodic critical theory applies both to bubbles ending in a sudden crash as well as to bubbles landing smoothly.

This is in fact a strong prediction of our rational model of imitative behaviour. What we have attempted here is not to explain why crashes happens or bubbles exists, but to quantify the process taking place during extended bubbles that very often lead to the rapid regime switching a crash represent. We have offered evidence that bubbles and anti-bubbles have log-periodic and power law characteristics and hence provides for a quantification of extended “moods” on the markets.

We have furthermore, provided a model which contains the observed signatures. Whether, as proposed, discrete scale invariance or some other mechanisms \[Sornette, 1998\] are responsible for the prominent log-periodic signatures observed, only a more detailed microscopic model can answer.",Predicting Financial Crashes Using Discrete Scale Invariance [Research paper],1632451430

3182,investing,nobjos,"There is an old saying on Wall Street.

&gt;There are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.

If you think about it, you can sell stocks for any number of reasons - downpayment for a house, a medical emergency, or just plain profit booking. But when you are using your hard-earned money to purchase a stock, there is only one reason. You expect the stock price to go up!

It’s not a hard stretch to imagine that company insiders who are in high-ranking positions (CXO’s, VP’s, Presidents, etc.) would have a better understanding of the company and its expected future performance than any financial analysts out there who are just working with publically available data. So if these well-informed insiders are making significant stock purchases, does that mean they expect the stock price to shoot up soon?

In this week’s analysis let’s put this to the test. **Can you beat the market if you follow the stock purchases made by company insiders?**

___

**Data**

The data for this analysis was taken from **openinsider.com**

it’s a free-to-use website that tracks all the trades reported on SEC Form 4 \[1\]. While there are a lot of transactions that are reported daily to the SEC, I kept the following conditions to reduce noise in the data.

* Only transactions done by CXO’s, VP’s and Presidents (people who have a significant view of the company strategy and operations) are considered.
* A minimum transaction value of 100K
* The transaction should be purchase (Not a grant, gift, or purchase due to options expiration)

The financial data used in the analysis is obtained from Yahoo Finance.

___

**Analysis**

For all the transactions, I calculated the stock price change across different time periods (One Week, 1-Month, 3-Months, 6 Months &amp; 1 Year) and then benchmarked the returns against S&amp;P500 over the same time period.

My hypothesis for choosing different time periods was to understand at what point would you generate the maximum alpha (if we realize any) over the benchmark. All the results are checked for outliers so that one or two stocks are not biasing the whole result.

___

 **Results** 

**Return Comparison - Companies with Insider Buying vs SPY**

|Time Period|Insider Purchase Stock Returns|S&amp;P 500 Returns|Alpha|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1-Week|1.9%|\-0.3%|2.1%|
|1-Month|3.6%|2.0%|1.6%|
|3-Months|11.3%|6.6%|4.7%|
|6-Months|17.0%|11.9%|5.1%|
|1-Year|39.7%|22.1%|17.6%|

Surprisingly, if you had followed the insider purchases, you would have beaten SPY across all 5 different timeframes. The alpha generated would also have increased with increasing timeframe with the insider purchase trades beating the S&amp;P500 by a whopping 17.6% over the period of one year.

I have kept 1-year timeframe as my limit mainly due to two reasons. First, I started the analysis for identifying short-term plays, and secondly, given our entire dataset is over the last 4 years, anything more than 1 year would not have data for a significant chunk of our population which can affect the analysis.

___ 

**Limitations to the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the trades.

* The data I collected has a lot of small-cap companies which are inherently more risky than a large-cap index like S&amp;P500. Given our returns are not risk-adjusted, the alpha we are seeing here might just be due to the higher risk you are taking on the trades \[2\]
* The analysis is limited to the last 4 years of data during which the markets were predominantly in a bull run (except the Covid-19 crash)
* Finally, this assumes that you will buy an equal amount of stock whenever a company insider does a trade which might not be practical given our inherent biases and apprehensions\[3\]

___

**Conclusion**

Usually, insider purchases are used to gauge the overall market sentiment. A very high proportion of sells over buys signify that insiders are losing confidence in the stock/industry and it’s time to get out of that market.

This analysis shows that the individual trades can be used for identifying stocks that are worth buying by analyzing the insider purchase patterns. This should be just considered as a primer into the topic as SEC Form 4 has a treasure trove of information \[4\].

You may or may not implement this strategy based on your investment style. But at the very least, you should check for the insider transaction pattern before investing in a particular security!

**Footnotes and Existing Research**

\[1\] SEC Form 4 is what an insider file when he/she makes a transaction. It’s expected to be filed within 2 days, but I observed more delay than that in many cases. For the purpose of this analysis, I have considered transactions that were reported no later than 10 days.

3253,investing,ILikeTalkn2Myself,"Ford Motor has tapped Redwood Materials to create a closed loop system for its upcoming deluge of electric vehicles — a partnership that will cover recycling production scrap and EVs at the end of their life as well as supplying the automaker with raw battery materials.

The deal comes as Ford adds more electric vehicles to its portfolio, including the Mustang Mach E that launched last year and the upcoming[ F-150 Lightning pickup truck](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ford-boosts-spending-to-increase-production-capacity-of-its-f-150-lightning-electric-truck/). Securing a supply of batteries — or the materials to make them — has prompted the automotive industry to partner with cell manufacturers and increasingly turn to companies like Redwood Materials.

Ford alone will require a hefty supply. The company’s global plans for battery electric vehicle calls for at least 240 gigawatt hours of battery cell capacity by 2030, according to the automaker. That is roughly 10 plants’ worth of capacity. Ford has previously said that 140 GWh will be required in North America, with the balance dedicated to other regions, including Europe and China.

“Closing the loop for us in our end-of-life products and allowing those to re-enter the supply chain will help us drive down costs,” Lisa Drake, Ford’s chief operating officer in North America, said during a press briefing. “Of course, it’ll help us reduce the reliance on importing a lot of the materials that we use today when we build the batteries. And then it’ll reduce the mining of raw materials, which is going to be incredibly important in the future as we start to scale on this space.”

All of this, Drake says, will made EVs cheaper and more sustainable.

Redwood Materials recycles scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. The company, which was founded and is led by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, says it can recover, on average, more than 95% of the elements like nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper.

Redwood then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and supplies those back to its customers, which today includes Panasonic at the Gigafactory in Nevada that it operates with Tesla and Envision AESC’s battery plant in Tennessee. Redwood has also partnered with Amazon to recycle EV and other lithium-ion batteries and e-waste from parts of their businesses. Redwood’s first automotive partnership was secured earlier this year with electric commercial vehicle manufacturer Proterra.

“The risk is that we find ourselves in a situation perhaps a little bit similar to current global semiconductor shortage if we don’t plan ahead, and if we aren’t strategic about the production capacity and the right regions at the right time,” Straubel said during the briefing.  

Under the partnership announced Wednesday, Redwood Materials will initially work with Ford to set up recycling within the automaker’s battery production network and then funnel the recovered raw materials back to the manufacturer to be used in batteries. While Ford didn’t provide specific details, that likely means working with its battery cell supplier SK.

In May, Ford and SK signed an initial agreement to create a joint venture — to be called BlueOvalSK — to produce approximately 60 gigawatt hours annually in traction battery cells and array modules, starting mid-decade.

The ultimate aim of the Redwood Materials-Ford partnership is to touch the entire battery lifecycle from recycling production scrap and supplying Ford with materials to creating recycling options for the end-of-life vehicles. That last piece is complex because Ford will no longer own its EVs, many of which will have multiple owners before they’re ready for the scrap heap.

The deal follows a string of announcements in recent months by Redwood Materials. The company recently raised more than $775 million — a round that TechCrunch learned includes $50 million from Ford. (The company initially announced the round was [more than $700 million](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/).)

It also revealed in September plans to [expand its business](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/jb-straubels-redwood-materials-is-expanding-into-the-battery-materials-business/) beyond battery recycling and into the production of critical battery materials at a new million-square-foot factory in the United States. Redwood wants to produce cathodes and anode foils, the building blocks of a lithium-ion battery structure.

The factory, for which the company is currently scouting a location, would likely be dedicated to the production of cathodes. Redwood has said it intends for the factory to ramp up to 100 gigawatt hours of capacity to produce cathode material, enough for one million electric vehicles by 2025.

3273,investing,nafizzaki,"Lobby groups are warning that activity in the world’s biggest bond market could grind to a halt at the end of this month without last-minute exemptions to an obscure 50-year-old rule in the US that has previously taken aim only at stocks.

Bond trade associations have written to regulators to say amended rules will have a “significant, deleterious effect” on government and corporate bond markets, and pleaded for an explicit reprieve, or more time to comply. The amendments were first proposed last year, but market participants assumed until recent months that the rules would continue to pertain to the stock market alone.

“We believe that such an application of the rule is overbroad and unnecessary”, wrote the Bond Dealers of America and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

The SEC’s 1971 statute, known as ‘rule 15c2-11’, governs the “publication or submission” of prices to buy and sell securities away from exchanges. Market participants have largely considered it an attempt to guard retail investors from predatory schemes and fraudulent activity in penny stocks. 

The rule requires broker dealers such as JPMorgan Chase and Citi to check a wide range of information on issuers, including quarterly and annual reports. Last year the SEC, then led by Jay Clayton, tweaked the rules for the first time in almost three decades, and included a requirement for the information to be publicly available.

“These retail investor-focused improvements to Rule 15c2-11 are long overdue,” said Clayton at the time, adding that advances in technology meant investors could be privy to more up-to-date information before trading.

The statute has never explicitly excluded bonds but, in practice, it has never applied to them in its 50-year existence. This has long suited a market where many corporate issuers are not listed on stock markets and do not routinely produce regular earnings reports. It is unclear what disclosures would be required for government bonds, such as those issued by the US Treasury.

But Michael Decker, vice-president of policy and research at BDA, said the SEC, led by new chief Gary Gensler, has confirmed the rules will also affect government and corporate bonds under the amendments outlined last year. Only municipal securities have an explicit exemption. 

“Here we are a matter of days away and very little work has been done. It is pretty clear to me that the SEC hasn’t really thought this through,” said Decker.

The SEC declined to comment. 

Rising awareness of the new requirements has sown confusion in the bond market as bankers, trading platforms and investors now face intense compliance demands ahead of an unforeseen month-end deadline. 

The concern is that without guidance or amendment from the SEC, trading in part of the bond market will cease when the rule comes into force at the end of this month, as broker dealers back away for fear of attracting an enforcement action from securities regulators. 

The SEC’s move comes at a time of increasing regulatory scrutiny of fixed income trading, with Gensler noting this month that he intends to bring greater efficiency and transparency to the market. 

Broker dealers are scrambling to understand how to gather, review and publish information on the companies whose bonds they trade. They are also questioning what counts as publication or submission of a quote on a bond — terms left undefined in the rule.

Bond trading has increasingly transitioned to trading on electronic venues, with prices streamed on screens. In an attempt to avoid publishing quotes, some market participants could shift trading back to phones until clearer guidance is available. 

“The risk is that if the broker dealers feel they can’t be in compliance based on the interpretation of their internal teams then they might be forced to stop quoting certain bonds to ensure they aren’t out of compliance,” said Kevin McPartland, head of research, market structure and technology at Greenwich Associates.",US bond lobbies warn SEC of severe disruption under rule change,1632370009

Essentially, it is insurance for the creditor in the case of default from a debtor. 

A creditor can get into these credit default swaps contracts, where a creditor pays a fixed amount to another party (the insurer) and when/if the debtor to the creditor defaults  the insurer will step in to make the creditor whole.

Now, people have known about Evergrande and their liquidity issues for about a year. Investors (Debtors) would have purchased these credit default swap contracts for Evergrande.

l'idée est surtout de développer des outils décentralisés avec Hedera, pas d'augmenter le volume de transactions spéculatives qui n'est finalement qu'une niche, ils veulent ajouter de la valeur dans les transactions et augmenter le volume (ex : décentralisé le KYC, le paiement, le track record des opérations et leur traitement comptable, l'emprunte carbone digitale par utilisateur, etc…) le DLT de Hedera est le plus régulé au monde, (une fois que les régulateurs vont secouer le cocotier on verra ceux qui restent en place)Un régulateur peut imposer un arrêt net des opérations des acteurs décentralisés et donc tué son business du jour au lendemain… ce sera pas le cas avec un partenaire comme Hedera

Do you think REITs better in my situation? Any opinion helps.

2) No big investor has more than a few percent invested in REITs (Warren Buffett, Ray Dalio, Lynn Alden etc.).

So if REITs are so good, why don't investors buy more REITs?

- 70% of wealth in China is held in property (elsewhere average is btw. 20 to 35%)
- Evergrande’s international payment obligations are due on Thursday
- 1/3 of current China GDP is created by construction and property related activity (builders, materials/commodities, industrials/machines, services, etc) 
- China property market (sales) has been lagging for some months already
- a lot of Chinese investors have been harmed by the regulatory actions of Chinese tech companies, hence sentiment sensibility is heightened



Outlines of 3x spill over scenarios 
----------------------------
1.) Unorderly containment + large spill over
Evergrande default spills over to other property and real estate firms in China with unorderly containment, leading to a considerable decline in many related industries (incl. services). Property prices in China would collapse and lead to a moderate sell-off -&gt; the rather significant negative GDP impact would hit Chinese wallets directly, leading to severe repercussions for China-focused firms (global) and China’s future growth in general

-&gt; large impact on international markets (most sectors), global crisis potential, quicker decline of China’s GDP, FED would have to delay tapering 


2.) Orderly containment - moderate spill over
Evergrande default spills over to other property firms in China with orderly containment, resulting in a moderate decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -&gt; the GDP decline would impact China’s domestic spending/consumption power and lead to a medium-long term cooling of the China property market

-&gt; moderate impact on international markets (few sectors only), less long-term effects, slow-paced decline of China’s core GDP


3.) Orderly containment - small spill over
Evergrande default spills over to a few selected property firms in China (with large leverage). China’s gov steps in quickly and aggressively to ensure an orderly containment with a direct relief to calm down markets, resulting in a small decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -&gt; the slight GDP decline would result in rather short-term consequences for China’s domestic spending/consumption power. The CCP would at least manage to keep property prices stable, the spill over effects would be barely visible.

# Overview

Cepton provides state-of-the-art, intelligent, lidar-based solutions for a range of markets such as automotive (ADAS/AV), smart cities, smart spaces, and smart industrial applications. Cepton’s patented MMT®-based lidar technology enables reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solutions that deliver long range, high resolution 3D perception for smart applications.

  

From the very start, Cepton has focused on the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) market. As disclosed in the S-4 filing, Cepton has the largest known lidar production award - GM selected Cepton as their lidar supplier for upcoming 2023-2027 cars featuring UltraCruise functionality.  Cepton has designed a suite of lidars exceptionally attractive to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like GM, Ford, and all other top 10 OEMs by being:

 - automotive grade
 - small form factor &amp; best-in-class performance
 - ultra competitive price (tech advantage)
 - partnership with tier 1 supplier (mass production)

  

Founded in April 2016 and led by industry veterans with over two decades of collective experience across a wide range of advanced lidar and imaging technologies, Cepton is focused on the mass market commercialization of high performance, high quality lidar solutions. Cepton is headquartered in San Jose, California, USA, with a presence in Germany, Canada, Japan and India, to serve a fast-growing global customer base.

  

Cepton is going public via a SPAC merger ticker **GCAC.** A [press statement](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/05/2275660/0/en/Cepton-Technologies-Inc-an-Innovator-in-Automotive-ADAS-Lidar-and-Growth-Capital-Acquisition-Corp-Enter-into-Business-Combination-Agreement.html) released on August 5th, 2021 suggests that the merger is ""expected to close in the Q4 2021"". The S-4 was filed September 8th, 2021, and is available [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001498233/000121390021047072/fs42021_growthcapital.htm#T29).

# Competition

  

Innoviz, Microvision, Velodyne, Aeva, Ouster, Aeye, Luminar

  

Cepton has a huge leg up on its competitors by having the largest production award (GM) as well as partnership with a key tier 1 supplier (Koito). According to both Cepton's investor presentation and S-4 filing, these things take considerable time (2+ years) &amp; have incredible competition (at least 30 lidars considered for GM production award). No other lidar company expects deployment on a significant number of vehicle models (especially non-luxury) anytime in the near future.

  

Microvision (MVIS) has completed their **prototype** lidar in April 2021. Cepton finished their prototype in 2017, and is currently fine tuning the mass production process. Futhermore, Microvision recently claimed that they would win the markets by being cheap and selling their lidars for an AVERAGE of less than $1000. Cepton lidars are &lt; $500 with the Nova lidar being &lt; $100. Needless to say, Cepton is not concerned with competition from Microvision at the moment.

  

Another interesting fact I noticed: many Velodyne and Innoviz leaders have left and decided to join Cepton.

-   **'25E Valuation:** 1.8x (Peer median 2.1x)
-   **'26E Valuation:** 1.3x (Peer median 2.1x)

  
  
  

As of writing this, GCAC is trading at $9.89, below the theoretical floor of $10 for SPACs.

  
  
  

# Bear Cases 

  

The merger falls apart. This seems quite unlikely as both Cepton and GCAC have experienced leadership &amp; backgrounds. 

  

Cepton's deal with GM falls through. While again this is theoretically possible, the chances seem very small based on the investor presentation &amp; S-4 filing. Cepton had been in talks with GM for years before the announcement, and GM went through an extensive selection process of over 40 other lidar companies. Furthermore, Cepton is already partnered and supported by Koito, a Tier 1 supplier already approved and supplying parts for GM vehicles. 

  

The AV market is a bust. Cepton is currently focused on mass-market Lidar serving ADAS, which is a very real &amp; growing market. While it is true that currently the lidar market is pretty saturated, there is definitely an addressable market for ADAS in vehicles in the next 5 years. Cepton's ability to actually land the largest known Lidar production deal is nothing to scoff at.

# Conclusion

  

Cepton has strong fundamentals, landed impressive deals and partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout leader in the lidar market. ADAS (safety &amp; assist) is not as sexy as AV (self driving), but there is a clear market for it TODAY, and Cepton has already taken the first step with the landmark deal to supply lidar for multiple GM cars.

  

As of writing this post, GCAC is trading at $9.89, and is a relatively low-risk investment as SPAC's typically have a $10 floor due to the ability to redeem the stock at closing of the merger for $10.

While the lidar &amp; SPAC markets are not so hot at the moment, I still see Cepton as undervalued at the moment, and the situation as a great low-downside investment opportunity. If Cepton succeeds with its engagements with all top 10 OEM's, then this current price would be one hell of a steal.

I bought &amp; plan to hold shares for several years. 

You can also just play the merger - buy now, then hold until the merger date &amp; decide then whether to keep or sell.
  
- Buy shares, GCAC will change to CPTN after the merger. Shares will be 1:1
- Warrants, GCACW, if you're not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50
- Options trading - buying calls &amp; selling puts

  
  

**TL;DR:** 

Cepton quietly landed massive deals &amp; partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout lidar company. Currently GCAC is trading at &lt;$10, which is usually the floor for SPACs. This seems like a fairly low-risk low-downside investment, with great upsides at the moment since awareness of Cepton is so low.

So obviously, today’s market drop doesn’t concern me in the least.

I have another $10,000 in a taxable account that I use for fun things: beer money, casino trips, video game purchases, spa treatments, etc.

This is money I am not investing for the long term. I will spend this down between now and retiring. I am more interested in capital preservation.

For this reason I invested this money in an “all-weather” portfolio, an idea pioneered by [billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/all-weather-portfolio/) and popularized in [Tony Robbins’ book “Money: Master the Game](https://fourminutebooks.com/money-master-the-game-summary/).

This portfolio is designed to make money in most any market and rarely ever lose money.

Here is how I have invested this $10,000:

* 30% Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)
* 40% iShares 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT)
* 15% iShares 7 – 10 Year Treasury ETF (IEF)
* 7.5% SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD)
* 7.5% PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC)

So far this portfolio has performed fine and I have been happy with the performance. 

I have not had a chance to see the all-weather portfolio put to the test…until today.

As I saw red everywhere today I opened up my Robinhood app with curiosity to check my balance.

I have no idea how my IRA did today and honestly don’t want to look but my all-weather portfolio was actually UP today by 0.02%.

I recommend this portfolio for short-term goals (savings for a house down payment, for example) or as a hedge against sequence of returns risk. If it’s money you don’t want to risk losing this might be worth checking out.",Had an interesting test today for my “all-weather” portfolio,1632170372

I'm a young guy with quite a lot of money very regularly coming in due to a Web3 project I have taking off. I live modestly and have been putting probably 80% of my income into investments. I've set a pretty comfortable risk tolerance, and my time horizon is more than 20 years.

I've found myself buying into $VOO on regular intervals lately. It feels safe, doesn't take a lot of time, etc. I've gradually been scaling into using margin, because I strongly believe that, over my time horizon, the returns I'll get from an S&amp;P index fund will beat out the 0.75% interest rate they offer me.

However, I learned about leveraged S&amp;P ETFs recently, such as $SPUU, $SSO, $UPRO. These mostly seem to have a higher expense ratio than $VOO, but my understanding is that these are able to achieve a similar leverage affect of using margin in the way I am, without using margin.

I was just wondering if I'm understanding this correctly. If I'm comfortable going in 1:1 on margin into $VOO, am I then better off just buying $SPUU and not using margin instead (assuming the expense ratios are in my favor). Are there any differences or disadvantages of these leveraged ETFs that I'm not understanding, when compared to going into $VOO on margin?",Leveraging into an S&amp;P index,1632172883

But once I decided to go for it with the S&amp;P, I started DCA in and pretty much went in at all the highs.

I wasn't there for the ride up, so just being there for the ride down doesn't seem that appealing.

3509,investing,th3cr1t1c,"There is no end to the number of blogs and Youtube videos that convince retail investors they too can be experts.  But what, really, is the value of that information?

There are three reasons earnings-based analyses are so popular in the investing world, even among some quasi-professionals, despite the fact that Discounted Cash Flow analysis is the preferred model for valuation across the entire industry^(1):

1. Earnings is the most readily available company metric on the internet.
2. Ratios are simple; analyses are complicated.
3. This information is cheap.

Beyond Time Value of Money, there's no more valuable information you're going to get from browsing the internet for free.  You can get access to certain types of research reports from Schwab and other discount brokerages, but it's not ""free"".  You've deposited money with and given order flow to these institutions, on which they in turn generate income.  But this is still relatively low value information compared to real, thorough equity research (it's often called ""Due Diligence"" here).  These reports cost money, and they're compiled by people with years of education and expertise, which in turn cost money.

So I'm sitting here next to a stack of just four books from my college years a quarter century ago:

1. Smith and Roberson's *Business Law.*
2. *Fundamentals of Financial Management* by Eugene F. Brigham.
3. *Management Accounting* by Anthony Atkinson &amp; Rajiv Banker (my professor).
4. *Security Analysis* by Dodd and Graham.

The fourth is by far the cheapest of them, because it's more widely used than in academia.  But together, these four books would today cost, in their hardcover editions, $1000... and that's just four introductory textbooks.  Nevermind the 4-5 years of school I had studying the soup-to-nuts of business management and, at the end of it, writing a thesis for a strategy formulation and implementation class that utilized all of the other learned disciplines in the development of a single, semester-long business case.

Very little of what analysts know in practice is something that can be distilled to the average investor without all of the years of underlying context.   Expecting you to digest this and beat the market would be like telling you to take a 5xxx or 7xxx level finance course and expecting you to place in the top 5% of the class, at a top 5% school.

So this is what really goes into business valuation exercises of any real worth.  Which is another way of saying: If you didn't pay for it, chances are it's not that valuable.

**There are three reasons that are preventing tech companies from growing faster:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Tech companies that don't have enough money.**

These are generally start-ups, or high-burn hungry tech companies. 

This manifests in two different ways:

1. Companies actively burning money, to show ""growth"" that is unsustainable.
2. Companies actively choosing to spend money, because they know it is going to pay off in the future (e.g. amazon spending billions on infrastructure). 

Avoid the former. Invest in the later.

**2. Tech companies that don't have enough talent.**

This manifests in two different ways.

1. High quality people don't want to work there. (avoid these companies). 
2. The company grew so fast, and hiring is still catching up (hyper growth co's). E.g. Zoom, Instacart, DoorDash, after covid. 

Avoid the former reason (not easily solved). Invest in the later (easily solved).

3539,investing,wallstjunky,"I know many of you reading this are DIY investors, and that is absolutely great!  For some of you, it might make sense now or later down the road to consider pursuing an Investment Advisor/Financial Advisor.  I myself, work for a Boutique RIA firm as a portfolio manager, and am in no way soliciting my business, but instead, I put together a list of questions to use as a guide for the ""Interview Process"".  Before I get into it, my recommendation if you choose to hire an Advisor, make sure they are a Fee-Only Fiduciary, this is usually the most transparent type of advisor out there.  This can protect you from being sold crappy investment products that put money in your advisors pocket that likely aren't best suited for you.

1.       Tell me about your qualifications and experience? 

You NEED to know how long your advisor has been in the industry and what education and designations they have.  The CFP, CFA, and CPA are some of the most prestigious and well-recognized designations that an advisor can have.

2.       What problems can you solve and what services do you provide?

Financial advisors can perform a multitude of different functions, so finding the one that fits your needs and has the expertise you are looking for.  You want an advisor is isn’t just one-dimensional (i.e. only selling insurance products) but rather can offer many different types of advice like real estate, equities, alternatives, etc.

3.       Who else stands to gain from the services you provide me?

You want a clear understanding of any other third parties that aim to benefit off the services your potential advisor is giving you.  Advisors that sell a certain product, mutual fund, or policy typically have a pre-arranged relationship that usually comes in the form of compensation when providing these products.

4.       Have you ever been professionally disciplined?

FINRA, CFA, state agencies, and CFP boards keep records on the disciplinary history of candidates and advisors.  You should verify with these entities if your potential advisor has ever been reprimanded or professionally disciplined.

5.       How secure are your services?

Cybersecurity is a serious issue, so you want to make sure what systems your advising company has in place, how the information is store, what software partners they are working with, and ultimately how is your sensitive data being stored.  At the end of the day, the Financial Advisor is going to have a lot of your personal financial data, so you just want to make sure how secure it really is.

6.       How much control do I have over decisions made?

FAs have different scopes of ability and services.  Some have complete discretion and control over the account with no client input, while other FAs serve as more of an educator and the client does have a lot of input.  If you are looking for someone to make all the investment-management decisions for you, then find an advisor that can serve in that capacity.  If, on the other hand, you are more of a DIY type investor, find an advisor that can serve as a second set of eyes while still giving you the ability to pick what securities or investment vehicles to include in your portfolio.

7.       How are you getting paid?

For any reputable FA can answer this question.  There isn’t one right answer for the fee structure that is best for you, but you definitely want one of transparent.  There are so many types of fee structures, so try to understand how your FA actually gets paid.

8.       Ask him or her to explain a concept to you

This allows you an opportunity to see their ability to communicate effectively.  A large part of the financial planning process comes in the delivery of the plan itself.  Choosing an advisor who can not only develop a comprehensive financial plan but also deliver it in a way that is well understood.

Below are five concept-oriented questions to consider asking:

* What is passive vs. active investing?
* How do you determine how much of my money should be in stocks vs. bonds?
* What is a [laddered bond](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/accounts_products/investment/bonds/individual_bonds/bond_ladders) portfolio?

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

**Technical Analysis**

📷

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

During its series A funding, it was talking about 99% accuracy in record time with its automatic speech recognition stuff. By its series B funding it was saying it would use human transcribers, because despite everyone's belief that automatic speech recognition can do what we do, there's actually some evidence from the racial disparities in automatic speech recognition study that's not true. 

So I know your subreddit appears to be geared toward public investing, but obviously, I see this as private equity throwing big money at what is likely to turn out to be a zombie company. You can draw a comparison with VIQ Solutions, which has not been profitable for as long as I've followed it. I'm wondering if any of you have involvement with those kinds of private funds, or how one would even get word to them that all is not as it seems.

There are also social and legal reasons I care about this, but I will mostly omit that here since it's more or less irrelevant to the topic of investing beyond the obvious point that they're trying to gain ground into a field that has a lot of competitors and in all likelihood the unicorn will become a money burn like Google's Deep Mind.

Hey all,

Wondering what you guys think of the idea of investing with a 100% stock portfolio for my 401k, roth and hsa contributions now-retirement and then going all bonds after once I have a nest egg I am comfortable with? I feel like for myself, this would be helpful and let me sleep better at night lol.

My theory is that this way if I invest my 3 accounts in indexed sp500 funds, over the next 17 years I will come out with much better gains than I would doing say a 70/30 split...THEN once I turn 50 I can assess how the market looks, maybe pull back a bit from 50-55 and if things are going ok at 70/30 I can go all bonds there on out and know my money won't plummet and sleep tight at night...if the market takes a shit when I am 50 then I can just work a couple extra years and wait for things to get back on track then go all Bonds...

Is this crazy talk? Am I better doing all stocks now-50 and then going 60/40 when I am 50+ and just ensuring I can live off 2.5-3% of my retirement nest egg and let the rest take care of itself?",Investment strategy or crazy talk?,1631811729

**TL/DR:** AAWW is critically undervalued. COVID has all but annihilated international air travel volumes, driving up the price of air freight. Short term shipping disruptions have caused prices to soar, spilling over in to the air freight market. Analysts are expecting this disruption to resolve quickly, but are missing the shifts that airlines are making to narrow body jets and the impact on air freight. AAWW will have high earnings for years, and its current P/E of 4 is a joke. 13.6% of the float is shorted, and Atlas Air is free to reinitiate buybacks at the end of this month. AAWW's market cap could double and it still would trade at the rock bottom P/E of 8. Bullish AF.

\------

**Thesis**

Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW) is critically undervalued at an absurdly low valuation given its great near- and long-term prospects; there several upcoming catalysts for a rapid revaluation.

**Background**

Atlas Air is an outsourced air services company that provides charter and other air services (""Airline Operations"") as well as leasing out their owned aircraft. Critically, the Airline Operations account for the vast majority of revenues (&gt;95%), and AAWW has a very, very heavy focus and exposure to air freight.

You may know that commercial flights also typically carry cargo. When COVID decimated international air travel, it left a few limited carriers to ship air freight internationally. Atlas Air filled that void and is making big money doing it.

**Short Term Prospects**

Beyond the COVID situation mentioned above, oceanliners have been backed up dramatically causing a squeeze in ocean freight prices. Normally, air freight costs very roughly 4-5x that of an oceanliner. But with surging rates from oceanliners, [air freight has now become competitive for many companies](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/a-perfect-storm-for-container-shipping/21804500) and it is spilling over in to a squeeze on air freight. [Here's another article joking about car tires flying first class.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/air-cargo-boom-has-car-tires-flying-first-class-11630242001) So we know that Atlas Air is going to have a pretty stellar third quarter. One for their corporate history books, to be sure. But how do they fare long-term?

**Long Term Prospects**

As a side note, I believe this is where the shorts are getting it very, very wrong. *I think* they are confident that while AAWW will have a great quarter, the freight rates will come back down again and AAWW will operate with only 'modest' profits like it did pre-COVID. What they are missing is a huge transformation in the airline industry from wide-body to narrow-body jets. Narrow-body jets carry far less cargo. Greenlight Capital did a fantastic job laying this out in it's July 26, 2021 investor letter (page 4, ""Air Freight""):

&gt;While there has been some recovery in passenger aviation, airlines are emphasizing narrow-body planes, which carry less freight than wide-body planes. Compared to 2019, current air freight demand is about 10% higher and capacity is about 10% lower. The result is that cargo rates have exploded.  
Supply will be slow to come on-line. Some passenger planes are being converted to freighters, but conversion capacity for wide-bodies is limited and the aggregate impact of this will be modest. Meanwhile, air freight companies trade at tiny multiples of what investors assume to be peak profits. The implied cost of equity is quite high, which makes it difficult to justify adding assets. As a result, air freight companies are in no rush to order new planes, and in any case, new orders would take several years to build. The result is rates and profits are likely to be higher than expected for quite some time.

(Sorry, I tried to link the letter but the spam bot didn't like the URL.)

**Short Interest**

For some reason I will never understand, at a P/E of 4 with incredible foreseeable cashflows, some people have decided to short 13.6% of the outstanding shares. To be clear, this is not GameStop. But it is a high short interest in a stock with earnings prospects surging by the day as freight rates increase. It certainly doesn't hurt. But the story gets even better...

**Upcoming Catalysts**

Okay, so perhaps you believe me that AAWW is critically undervalued, that they're going to make some amazing Q3/Q4 profits, and that their long term prospects are pretty fantastic too. What will drive this rapid revaluation in the coming months? The answer was subtly slipped in to the last earnings call (google ""AAWW Transcripts Q2 2021 Earnings Call""). Spencer Schwartz, the EVP and CFO answered a question and stated:

&gt;As far as the CARES Act restrictions, so the restrictions with regard to not being able to pay dividends or repurchasing shares, those expire at the end of September.

I simply cannot imagine that in this time of record earnings, AAWW will not return that value to shareholders. If they were to announce a share buyback once the CARES Act restrictions lap, we could see AAWW finally get to a reasonable share price. I truly believe this could double in the short-term.",DD: Atlas Air (AAWW) is laughably undervalued and has near term catalysts for a rapid revaluation,1631829856

3897,investing,nobjos,"We have all heard it! -- “Time in the market beats timing the market”

At the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It’s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**

**Analysis**

For this, let’s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \[1\]  

For analysis simplicity, let’s assume that you were on a conservative side and never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&amp;P500 \[2\]. For investment amount, let consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and for every subsequent year increased your investments by 5%. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years.  

**Results**

**Investment Returns : S&amp;P 500 (1993-2021)**

|**Scenario**|**Return**|
|:-|:-|
|Invested only during a market crash|391.9%|
|Invested when markets were lowest every year|371.2%|
|Invested every month an equal amount|312.9%|
|Invested at a random date every year|303.2%|
|Invested when markets were highest every year|263.1%|

 

The analysis did throw up some interesting results. There’s a lot to unpack here and let’s break it down by each segment.

The most important insight is that **it’s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \[3\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let’s consider some more realistic scenarios.      

If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.

Out of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.

While this seems like a good idea, in theory, it’s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It’s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.

b. [Identifying a crash itself is very hard](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f96f61-9b99-4d4a-b6cd-88eece3ecc1d_624x241.png)

 As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it’s going into a deeper crash or whether it’s going to bounce back up.

**Conclusion**

While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it’s very difficult to execute it.

For e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up.     

It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \[4\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.

If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.

Amid the deluge of headlines in the past few days about congressional proposals to boost taxes on companies and the wealthy is one that would affect regular investors -- and potentially alter the entire U.S. fund landscape.

Draft legislation released by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon on Friday **featured a repeal of a key tax advantage for the $6.8 trillion U.S. exchange-traded fund industry.** The move was tucked in along with a series of proposals to tighten tax reporting requirements around business partnerships, and wasn’t highlighted in Wyden’s accompanying press release.

The initiative would at a stroke **end a system of deferred taxes on capital gains linked to ETFs, bringing forward the tax burden for investors of all stripes.** That will make it all the tougher to win inclusion in the final version of tax hikes that Democrats are now assembling to help pay for a social-spending package that’s been penciled in at $3.5 trillion.

“The industry will push back hard” at the proposal, said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. “It’s hard for me to see this getting popular support -- in large part because it’s a benefit that is universal, so all investors, large, small and in-between, that are investing taxable money benefit from ETFs’ tax efficiency.”

The measure would bring in $205 billion over a decade, according to preliminary figures from the Joint Committee on Taxation. It would take effect in tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2022. Wyden said in a statement Tuesday that, “This proposal exempts retirement accounts entirely.”

Wyden’s proposal was made before his committee delivers its draft of tax measures for inclusion in the budget-reconciliation bill that will form the bulk of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda.

The effort would address an advantage for ETFs that stems from a law dating back to the Nixon administration. The law exempts so-called regulated investment companies, or RICs, from recognizing a taxable gain on assets if shareholders are paid out “in kind.” In other words, if withdrawing investors are paid in securities like stocks rather than in cash.

**ETFs are structured so that money flows in and out via facilitators known as authorized participants, and redemptions for a fund almost always take place in-kind. That means that if there are enough withdrawals, an ETF can avoid recognizing taxable gains entirely. Rather than paying a tax on a fund’s gains each year, investors usually don’t pay anything until they sell their ETF.**

“Because ETFs are pass-through vehicles, by definition every cent of the increased tax flows through directly to the shareholders -- not all of whom are filthy rich,” Jeremy I. Senderowicz at law firm Vedder Price said by email.

Some ETF managers use so-called heartbeat trades to increase the amount of withdrawals and erase all of a fund’s taxable gains. A friendly bank moves a pile of cash into a fund before almost immediately pulling it out, allowing the ETF to shed stocks that have gone up in value without incurring a taxable gain.

“This particular proposal simply applies the same rules already in place for corporations to regulated investment companies, so wealthy investors can no longer avoid all tax on their gains,” Wyden said in his statement Tuesday. “We’re only talking about the taxable accounts of the wealthiest investors.”

A summary of Wyden’s proposal mentions heartbeat transactions in particular, although he proposes to erase the entire provision that allows RICs to avoid recognizing gains. The proposal “would repeal the exception for RICs, aligning RICs with the general requirement that gain be recognized upon distribution by a corporation of built-in gain property,” the summary said.

That’s a potential industry game-changer. While ETFs tend to have several advantages over mutual funds -- like the ability to trade all day and generally lower fees -- research has shown the tax loophole is a key driver in the long-term trend of cash flowing from mutual funds into ETFs. As that has gathered pace, U.S. issuers are this year for the first time directly converting mutual fund assets into ETFs.

The final package of tax hikes, including ones on corporations and wealthy individuals, may takes weeks to develop.

“Wyden right now is coming up with his own provisions that could fit into that” final legislation, said Nathan Dean, a government analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Think of this as something to have in his hip pocket when the Democrats start negotiating.”

The odds may be against the ETF-related legislation ever passing, Dean said. First, because so much negotiation is still ahead, and second because it would directly impact ETFs, which are very popular with consumers. However, with so much currently up for discussion, it could slip through as a smaller provision not well-understood by lawmakers, he said. 

Senderowicz thinks the legislation has a low chance of succeeding because of the potential damage to many small investors -- but he also doesn’t rule it out.

“It’s impossible to disguise the incidence of the tax increase and thus lends itself well to political attacks,” said Senderowicz. “But if it’s a choice between it and the entire reconciliation bill coming apart?”",New congressional draft legislation seeks to end tax efficiency of all ETFs,1631732907

A quick Google shows UBS, Merrill Lynch, eTrade, and Morgan Stanley all offer some way for you to borrow at least 50% of the value of your equities for around 2% or less.

I'm guessing the flow is:

1. Have $1m-$10m in equities

2. Take an SBLOC of 50% of the value at 2%

3. Live your life (spend $400k-$1m/yr doing whatever it is rich people do)

4. Pay the interest back every year, keep receiving dividends, never sell any of your equities until it is time to have repaid the loan / you ran out of cash (say every 5 years), and since then your stocks have grown so you never really have less than the original number you started with equity wise

Many industries also mature to the point where it's only profitable for a handful of companies to operate, which can be profitable for those which survive. For an example, look at the memory semiconductor manufacturing industry. Lots of consolidation over the past two years like Intel selling its NAND business to SK Hynix and Western Digital buying Kioxia. 

My question is, what are some duopolies in relatively attractive industries? Regardless of market cap. I'll start: 

$V and $MA: one of the first duopolies many people think of, the two companies with a solid grip on the payment processing space. Have been some worries about new technology/entrants as of late but the chart for these companies tells the story. 

$WM and $RSG: waste management is a highly fragmented industry but these two companies have come out on top after Republic Services (the 3rd largest at the time) bought Allied Waste (2nd largest) in 2008. Many think of garbage disposal as a boring, defensive industry akin to utilities, but both stocks are up 150% in five years (good but not great) with a 1.5% dividend, good management and should (theoretically) offer decent downside protection in an economic downturn. 

Semiconductor capital equipment: not listing individual stocks because the entire industry is a series of duopolies between $ASM, $LRCX, $AMAT, $TOELY, and $KLAC.

So, this is specifically for real estate. Generally, if you own your (residential, at least) property, you can get an equity based loan at the going rate to get some cash. I know Ukraine rates are higher than the US, but are they that much higher? Pretty sure you can do a home equity loan for like 6%, and I have to assume larger commercial loans are even lower. Plus they could do a full refinance for even lower rates in the 2-3% range. I don't see how tokenizing and effectively selling 40% of your building and forfeiting a percentage of future profits is a better deal than getting a loan from a bank for 40% of the building's value at a 2-6% interest rate... and getting to keep all the profits on top of that. Unless Ukraine interest rates are like 15-20% or something, seems like the bank is a better option. I'm probably just missing something, but my question is what is the draw to bring future properties in? Why would they choose this route over traditional finance?



I definitely get the SME side, but still trying to wrap my head around the benefits for real estate owners. Are they selling portions of the property they still owe money on? That seems quite risky.

Another way to invest in growing and hyped-up industries is to invest into companies that produce the supplies for these industries, rather than the big-names at the face of it. Not to mention, you're more likely to win if you invest in a supplier versus a small cap company looking to get in on the next big thing. In some industries, like electric cars, the hype has already consumed supply such as lithium battery stocks.

This discussion is primarily inspired by /u/Thereian's comment describing these kind of stock picks:

&gt;ENTG - Semiconduct manufacturing supplier. They supply all major players. Lots of battles going on in this industry but no matter who wins (Taiwan Semi, Intel, etc) they get paid. And all of the investment that Intel and Taiwan Semi are making to build billions of dollars worth of FABs? Yeah, Entegris will get their chunk of that money. They sell the equipment upfront and the consumables going forward. Truly a fantastic company, I've owned since 2009 and am still completely bullish.

&gt;TMO - Similar to the above philosophy. Lots of expensive cell and gene therapy companies out there, those are high risk. But there's a low-risk high-reward play: Thermo Fisher. Just like ENTG in the example above, Thermo is a supplier to the whole industry. While those biotechs remain unprofitable, the suppliers are getting paid and Thermo is making absolute bank in a rapid growth industry and yet it trades at a PE of 20...absurd. It'll double or triple in a couple years.

&gt;I'm an engineer focused on raw materials, so I'm a bit biased but I have seen suppliers make money hand over fist while the companies buying these things are burning cash or barely scraping by. Thats what drove me to look in to high-moat suppliers in the first place and I will continue to.

 TERMINATION OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES PROGRAM

This announcement is made by China Telecom Corporation Limited (the “Company”) on a voluntary basis.

We refer to the announcement of the Company dated 7 May 2021 in relation to the review decision by The New York Stock Exchange LLC (the “NYSE”) that the NYSE determined to delist the American Depositary Shares of the Company (the “ADSs”).

The delisting of the Company’s ADSs has taken effect on 18 May 2021. In light of the delisting, the board of directors (the “Board”) of the Company resolved to terminate the ADSs program (the “ADS Program”) on 9 September 2021. On the same day, the Company entered into a letter agreement with The Bank of New York Mellon, as the depositary for the Company’s ADSs, for the termination of the ADS Program.

As of 9 September 2021, the number of ADSs in issue was approximately 0.813 million and the number of H shares underlying the ADSs represented approximately 0.09% of the Company’s total issued shares. The Bank of New York Mellon has given a notice to all holders of ADSs that the ADS Program will terminate on 8 December 2021 (U.S. Eastern time) (the “Termination Date”). Holders of ADSs will have the right, at least until the Termination Date, to return the ADSs to The Bank of New York Mellon in exchange for H shares of the Company with each ADS returned to be exchanged into 100 H shares of the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of the deposit agreement. The Company’s H shares are traded on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. The Bank of New York Mellon expects to commence the sale of H shares of the Company represented by the remaining ADSs as soon as practicable after the Termination Date, and will pay the net cash proceeds, after deducting applicable fees and expenses, to the holders of such remaining ADSs.","Advice on a Delisted stoock and recent ""Termination of Shares"" notice - what to do?",1631642689

4030,investing,ORCoast19,"I’ve been buying OXY/WS this month, kicking myself for not buying them a year ago when I first learned of them. OXY/WS is the cheapest way to invest in OXY if you believe the share price will go up significantly. They essentially give you the right to buy shares at $22 plus the current warrant price. You have up until Aug 3 2027 to exercise this right. These warrants were issued to OXY shareholders during hard times in 2020, to throw them a bone, but I imagine most bailed as the stock collapsed. 

Four reasons I like this play are…

1. Rising Free Cash Flow. Occidential petroleum has been benefiting from an increasing WTI crude oil price, hovering around $70/barrel as of today. Last quarter it averaged around $65/barrel, and they had cash flow in that quarter above 2 billion (market cap is currently ~24.4 billion for reference). Cash flow should continue to increase as crude price increases, and they work to pay down their crippling debt.

2. The Crippling Debt is Going Away. No one likes debt, right? Especially crippling debt that might bankrupt you in a sudden, extreme downturn? *cough* Covid 2020 *cough*. Apparently management got the message that their debt load could kill them, and have a plan to reduce debt by over 40%, planning to drop from 34 billion in debt at the end of 2020 to 20 billion in debt at the end of 2022. As debt gets paid down the current interest payments of 300+ million/quarter will reduce to under 200 million/quarter, adding over half a billion extra to their free cash flow!

3. Inflation Hedge. OXY has a lot of hard assets, and if US inflation takes off their stock should rise. An example of these hard assets can be found in their land holdings- they own over 1.35 million acres in the permian basin alone. If inflation is high over the next 6 years, I feel the time value of OXY/WS is being very underappreciated. As of today that time value is under $6 per warrant. 

4. Future Energy Needs. Going back to the permian basin, the land that oxy has might one day be reused for alternative energy. Believe it or not, massive solar projects can hit a wall due to environmental groups. Below’s a link of this issue recently cropping up in San Diego. For some reason, I don’t think Texas will give a damn about environmental issues, making that previously mentioned 1.35 million acres in the permian basin prime real estate for massive solar projects. In addition to solar potential, OXY has also been working on CO2 sequestering using their pre-existing oil drilling footprint.

&gt;CHINA TELLS BANKS EVERGRANDE WON'T PAY INTEREST DUE SEPT. 20

https://twitter.com/Fxhedgers/status/1438016209765605377

&gt;FITCH WIRE: FITCH DOWNGRADED CHINA EVERGRANDE GROUP TO 'CC' FROM 'CCC+' ON 7 SEPT, INDICATING THAT WE VIEW A DEFAULT OF SOME KIND AS PROBABLE

More context:

https://www.reuters.com/business/fitch-says-possible-china-evergrande-default-may-have-broader-effects-2021-09-15/

&gt;Rating agency Fitch said that numerous sectors could be exposed to heightened credit risk if China's No.2 property developer Evergrande Group (3333.HK) were to default, although the overall impact on the banking sector would be manageable.

&gt;Evergrande is scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers, as it teeters between a messy meltdown with far-reaching impacts, a managed collapse or the less likely prospect of a bailout by Beijing. read more

&gt;Regulators have warned of broader risks to the country's financial system if the company's $305 billion of liabilities aren't contained.

&gt;""We believe a default would reinforce credit polarisation among homebuilders and could result in headwinds for some smaller banks,"" Fitch said in a note late on Tuesday.

&gt;Fitch downgraded China Evergrande Group to ""CC"" from ""CCC+"" on Sep. 7, indicating that it viewed a default of some kind as probable.

&gt;On Tuesday, Evergrande said it has engaged advisers to examine its financial options and warned of cross-default risks amid plunging property sales and lack of progress in asset disposals. read more

&gt;Fitch said 572 billion yuan ($88.8 billion) of Evergrande's borrowings were held by banks and other financial institutions, but banks may also have indirect exposure to the developer's suppliers, who are owed 667 billion yuan for goods and services.

&gt;""Smaller banks with higher exposure to Evergrande or to other vulnerable developers could face significant increases in non-performing loans (NPLs), depending on how any credit event involving Evergrande develops,"" Fitch said.

&gt;But the agency added a recent People’s Bank of China sensitivity test showed the average capital adequacy ratio of the 4,000 banks in the country would only drop modestly if the NPL ratio for property-development loans were to rise by 15 basis points.

&gt;Evergrande's Hong Kong-listed stock slipped as much as another 5% to HK$2.82 on Wednesday morning, a fresh low since Jan 2014.

&gt;Its property management unit (6666.HK) and EV unit (0708.HK), however, bounced as much as 10.4% and 9.3%, respectively.

&gt;In the debt market, Evergrande's Shanghai traded July 2022 bond fell 5.6% to 28.3 yuan, while its dollar bond due March 2022 dropped 20% to 27.502 cents, yielding more than 500%.

&gt;Fitch also said the risk of significant pressure on house prices in the event of a default would be low, and it expected the government would act to protect households’ interests to ensure home deliveries.

&gt;On Wednesday, roughly 40 protesters stood near the entrance at Evergrande headquarters in Shenzhen, prevented from going inside by dozens of security personnel.

&gt;This followed chaotic scenes at the headquarters two days earlier, as disgruntled investors crowded its lobby to demand repayment of loans and financial products.

&gt;Some videos circulating on Chinese social media also showed what were described as Evergrande-related protests elsewhere in China.","China has just told investors that Chinese Commercial Real Estate developer Evergrande wont pay interest due on September 20, Fitch downgrades rating to CC, from CCC+, indicating that they view a default of some kind as probable",1631684986

   House Democrats proposed several changes to retirement accounts as part of a push to make the tax code more equitable and raise money for their $3.5 trillion budget plan.
    Among them, the reforms would end “backdoor” and “mega-backdoor” Roth strategies for the wealthy and add new rules for individuals with retirement savings over $10 million.
    The legislation would also disallow IRA investments that require owners to be accredited investors.


House Democrats proposed a slew of changes to retirement accounts for the rich on Monday, part of a restructuring of the tax code tied to a $3.5 trillion budget plan.

Taken together, Democrats’ reforms aim to erode the use of retirement accounts as a perceived tax shelter for the wealthy and instead promote them as a way for low- and middle-income Americans to build a nest egg.

Most of the changes would start in 2022.

Wealthy individuals with retirement accounts exceeding $10 million would be prohibited from contributing extra savings and would have a new required minimum distribution each year, according to an outline of tax legislation unveiled Monday by the House Ways and Means Committee.

VIDEO03:23
House Democrats propose corporate tax rate of 26.5%

The bill would also repeal so-called Roth conversions in individual retirement accounts and 401(k)-type plans for those making more than $400,000 a year. It would also prevent savers from using the “mega-backdoor Roth” strategy, regardless of income level.

Further, the legislation would prohibit individual retirement accounts from holding investments that require buyers to be accredited investors, a status generally reserved for wealthy investors.

The proposals are part of a broader theme of raising taxes on those who earn more than $400,000 a year to help pay for education, climate, paid-leave, child-care and other measures while also making the tax code more equitable.

They also follow Democrats’ outcry following a recent ProPublica report that Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder, owns a Roth IRA that had grown to $5 billion in 2019, up from less than $2,000 in 1999.

“IRAs were designed to provide retirement security to middle-class families, not allow the super wealthy to avoid paying taxes,” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said in July after a data release showing growth of “mega” IRAs.

Democrats have narrow margins within which to pass a bill, which they aim to do with a simple majority via a budget reconciliation maneuver.

Republicans remain staunchly opposed. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, framed the spending as the “greatest expansion of the welfare state in our lifetimes” during a Thursday hearing, saying that it “wastes hard-earned tax dollars.”
Contribution limits

Current law lets taxpayers make IRA contributions regardless of account size.

However, the legislation would prohibit individuals from making more contributions to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA if the total value of their combined IRA and defined-contribution plan exceeds $10 million. A defined-contribution plan is a 401(k) plan or other similar workplace savings plan.

The policy’s purpose would be “to avoid subsidizing retirement savings once account balances reach very high levels,” according to a proposal outline.

That limit would apply to single taxpayers with more than $400,000 of taxable income. The threshold would be $450,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly and $425,000 for heads of household.
RMDs for ‘mega’ IRAs

Individuals whose combined traditional IRA, Roth IRA and defined-contribution retirement accounts exceed $10 million at year’s end would have to withdraw at least 50% of the excess the following year.

Those with account totals exceeding $20 million must pull from Roth IRAs and 401(k) plans first.

These new required minimum distributions for mega IRAs would only be required for savers whose taxable income exceeds the same thresholds identified above for the contribution limits.
Backdoor Roth

There are income limits to contribute to Roth IRAs. In 2021, single taxpayers can’t add money to such accounts if their income exceeds $140,000.

But current law allows for “backdoor” contributions to Roth IRAs. That can be achieved by converting a traditional IRA or Roth 401(k) account, which don’t carry income limits. There are income limits that determine whether contributions to traditional IRAs are tax-deductible or not.

Savers pay tax on the conversions, but their future investment growth and retirement distributions are tax-free.

The legislation would end the backdoor Roth IRA strategy by eliminating Roth conversions for both IRAs and workplace plans such as 401(k) plans.

The policy would apply at the same income thresholds listed above. It would count for distributions, transfers and contributions made in taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2031.
Mega backdoor Roth

The so-called “mega-backdoor Roth” strategy uses a principle similar to that of the backdoor Roth.

The strategy lets high earners save up to $58,000 in a 401(k) plan — more than the traditional $19,500 contribution limit — using a type of after-tax 401(k) bucket. Savers then convert that savings to a Roth account, once again yielding the benefit of tax-free investment growth.

Democrats’ legislation would end the mega-backdoor Roth by prohibiting all after-tax contributions in workplace plans and prohibiting after-tax IRA contributions from being converted to a Roth account.

This policy would apply for everyone, regardless of income level.
Accredited investors

Democrats’ legislation would disallow IRA investments that require the owner to have a minimum level of assets or income, or to have completed a minimum level of education or obtained a specific license or credential.

This would apply, for example, to accredited investors seeking to buy a private investment.

IRAs with these investments would lose their IRA status — meaning they’d lose their tax benefits.

These rules would apply starting in 2022, but there’d be a two-year transition period for IRAs already holding these investments.","House Democrats propose new retirement plan rules for the rich, including contribution limits and a repeal of Roth conversions",1631571383

Learned a lot and it was interesting even though it was only a month there. Wish it could be longer, it was a different country too. 

After a year of investing and researching the stock market every single day, I decided to make the big jump and start an e-commerce store. I was still under 18 and had to use my parents behalf to start it. It was a big jump. The website and products were great, but the only issue was that I didn’t know how to drive traffic and customers that were going to make a purchase. I didn’t know how to market my products. And just because a business is visually good it doesn’t mean that the business can perform well. Starting my own business was great, I learned more in those 2 months (I know its short) than I did in my freshman year of college. 

This was the only issue, however I did learn how important every part of a business is., and how one bad part of a business can cause it to fail. I also had to learn some basic marketing stuff on my free time.

For married filing jointly with a taxable income of less than $80k, the tax on long term capital gains is 0%. With the standard deduction of $24k, that means your income can be up to $104k before your would start paying taxes on long term capital gains. Add in some above the line deductions like HSA contributions, traditional 401k contributions, health insurance premiums, student loan interest, and any tuition and you can easily exceed the $110k income number that I used earlier. 

If your income is less than that amount you could sell your holdings until your realized gains reach that limit  and you would pay 0% tax on them. You could immediately rebuy them at a new cost basis and continually do this year after year until your income exceeds the limit. then when you finally sell, you would be using a much higher cost basis than if you held through all those years. 

Obviously you could do this if you were single as well, but all the amounts would be halved due to the lower tax thresholds.

Is anyone out there doing this? Is there something I'm missing? Some of my investments will reach long term status at the beginning of the year and I can't see any reason not to sell and buy them back since I'm well below the $80k taxable income limit.","If you make less than $110k and are married, you should be taking long term capital gains every year from your taxable accounts, I think?",1631601918

Obviously I'm earning 0 interest and so am looking at putting this in to an index fund that tracks the S&amp;P500 instead. I'm confused however about how I actually go about doing this and have some questions. 

I downloaded Plus500 and played with the demo account to see if I could get my head around it.

1) Is the US500 (Indeces) the same as the S&amp;P500. If not, what's the difference? There is no S&amp;P500 listed on the app in my locality. 
2) I'm confused by the leverage. I don't want to leverage anything. I want the money I invest to be invested, not more which would open me up to potential losses over my assets (although unlikely obviously in an index fund). However, when I go to buy in the demo, the only option is to leverage at 1:20. I can't just say ""Ok, put 150 in to this"" for example).

This has been emphasised by many top traders and professional finance managers. Many fail in the forex industry because they get emotionally attached to their trades. When you bring emotions to the table, you are not making informed decisions based on facts and logic, so this increases the likelihood of losing the trade. Learn to leave your emotions at the door (so to speak); so this means not getting angry, shocked, upset, overexcited and not falling in love with any charts or currency pairs. Even though you may have favourite pairs that you enjoy trading, try your best not to get attached as they can break your heart ‘in a heartbeat’ - if you’re not careful.

**A habit that was very helpful - making** ***prediction trades*** **or paper trades (not real trades).** Helps with your mind frame on the industry because the more you do this the better you get, the more you learn and the more confident you are. When a person is confident, good things usually happen to them and in this case your trading improves and that equates to more success.

**When starting out, it’s crucial to understand that the money will not come straight away but it will eventually.** It’s easy to get carried away because of the excitement of starting this new forex journey and wanting to be profitable right away - it cannot work like that - you have to start slow and steady. One way this was achieved was to *prove* to myself that I could gain *pips* and percentages - not the money. Understanding that pips make the money, you’ll also know that if you can consistently accumulate the pips then the money will follow. Do not get greedy; learn your craft before you focus on the money.

**One important habit in forex and life in general is exercising** ***self-control*** **and having** ***patience.*** These are key factors and major characteristics that are needed to be a great trader - it’s like waiting for a bus; another setup will come in five minutes (well probably longer but you get the drift). Sitting on our hands a lot of the time is part of package.

**Do** ***tests*** **and exercises to stimulate the brain every now and then.** This is a great tactic to put you in the frame of mind of knowing that this is serious and that you need to revise, research and train for forex. An example of a test would be to set yourself 10 questions to answer weekly, almost like an exam when you were in college. This will help keep the mind fresh on key aspects of the industry.

Beijing wants to break up Alipay, the 1bn plus-user superapp owned by Jack Ma’s Ant Group, and create a separate app for the company’s highly profitable loans business, in the most visible restructuring yet of the fintech giant.

Chinese regulators have already ordered Ant to separate the back end of its two lending businesses, Huabei, which is similar to a traditional credit card, and Jiebei, which makes small unsecured loans, from the rest of its financial offerings and bring in outside shareholders. Now officials want the two businesses to be split into an independent app as well.

The plan will also see Ant turn over the user data that underpins its lending decisions to a new credit scoring joint-venture which will be partly state-owned, according to two people familiar with the process.

“The government believes big tech’s monopoly power comes from their control of data,” said one person close to financial regulators in Beijing. “It wants to end that.”

The move may slow down Ant’s lending business, with the enormous growth of Huabei and Jiebei partly powering its planned IPO last year. The CreditTech unit, which includes the two units, overtook Ant’s main payment processing business for the first time in the first half of 2020, to account for 39 per cent of the group’s revenues.

4416,investing,embrace-ur-elements,"Hi everyone. I want to make a simple point and have a debate about the SP500 valuation.  Basically, the big question we all have to ask ourselves is what is the longterm annualized return on the SP500 if we invest at these levels? I have seen people calculate this based on the current forward PE estimate and I believe this is highly dangerous!

Here is the common argument I see on here:

SP500 forward PE is at 22. Therefore we have a 4.5% earnings yield. Then given historical real earnings growth of the SP500 of 2%, we should see a 6.5% real return if investing at these levels. This isn't bad comparing to negative real yield offered by TIPs. And a measily nominal yield of 1.34% nominal yield of the 10yr. Therefore SP500 is fairly attractive. 

However, I don't think we should be assuming the real earnings implied by the forward PE is a reasonable starting place for this calculation. Now, I wouldn't be surprised if this is what we see in the next couple of years, but can we really assume this will last? Current forward PE of 22 on SP500 at 4500 means we expect to see 205 in real earnings which I will argue cannot last outside of the next few years.

Instead here are what I believe to be more accurate depiction of what the true earnings will be going forward on a real, averaged level. This will determine forward annualized returns.

**Estimate 1: 2019 real earnings is 140.  (Also max real earnings of SP500 is 140).**

This isn't the most reliable estimate but it is telling. The reason that it is telling is that it is the pre-covid earnings of the SP500 and recent. Not only that but it is also the all time high real earnings for the SP500 and occurs after a period of recovery fueled by extreme debt. Now of course 2019 is backward looking so if we account using a 2% real earnings growth rate, then we get to 148 in SP500 real earnings going forward.

**Estimate 2: CAPE Ratio is 40 implying 112.5 in real earnings for 10 year average. Adjusting for earnings growth the ratio is 36.5 implying 120 in real earnings.**

Now CAPE ratio, as it is the PE ratio with E being the average of the last 10 years of inflation adjusted earnings, is somewhat backward looking. Although it does account for inflation it does not account for natural growth in earnings. If we take the historical geometric mean of 2% annualized real earnings growth and adjust CAPE for this, then the CAPE ratio is 36.5 or about 120 in real earnings. This better reflects what earnings are likely to be going forward. Personally I believe this estimate to be the most fair measurement.

**Forward PE predicts 205 in real earnings for SP500.**

This tells me one should not use the forward PE for SP500 to forecast the earnings of the SP500 for the next decade as it would be 50% above all time high earnings that occurred in 2019. It is also 70% more than 10 year averaged earnings (with an adjustment for earnings growth and inflation to make it more realistic).

So we cannot possibly expect forward PE to give us a meaningful idea of the levels we are investing in! The danger is that forward PE may convince investors they will likely earn a 6.5% long term real annualized return (say 30 years) by investing at these levels and maybe a drawdown to say a 10PE would only mean a 50% decline.

However, more realistically, investors in SP500 will likely have a 4.7% real long term annualized return say (30 years) by investing in the SP500. Also if we are to revert to a 10 CAPE this could imply a crash as big as 75% in the near to medium term.

**TL;DR**

Your long term rate of return for the SP500 at these levels will not be 10% real. It will not even by 6.5% real which using the forward PE might imply. Instead it will likely be closer to 4.7% real with the risk of a drawdown as big as 75% in the near to medium term.

Now I'm not saying to hold cash, gold, crypto or whatever instead. I think stocks are the most sensible long term investment still because a 4.7% real return is still nice. However, they aren't for everyone! You will only realize this level of return in the long term and in the interim your portfolio could be down 50-75% meaning you would have a HEFTY penalty if you had to take out early. So is this hefty penalty worth it for the 5% real return? This is what we must ask.",Forward PE Estimate for SP500 will fall short over next 10 years,1631297890

Its subcontractor Carl Zeiss which is among the world leaders in optics technology has also seen its stock value increase but not by as much despite being crucial for advanced litography and frankly, in my estimation, far ahead of the competition.

I'm thinking about the potential upside but what keeps me back is the fact that: 1 despite being high-value-added there is only so much potential demand for advanced optics, lasers and such and 2 the highly specialized engineering cannot be scaled up in the same way, say car or battery production can. Still I think it's a safe medium and long-term bet but the oppertunity cost of putting money in Zeiss compared to obvious growth industries like battery is unclear.

Some food for thought perhaps.",Carl Zeiss as exposure to investments in semiconductor production,1631301885

4443,investing,ploobadoof,"Ok, so if bond prices fall, the value of bond ETF’s that hold those bonds also falls. If I buy bonds I want a high yield, right? Yield is the return I’m getting on that bond. So if I buy a $10,000 bond with a coupon rate of 10%, yearly coupon is $1,000 interest income. But I also want to buy this $10,000 bond for a discounted price. Let’s say $6,000 discount bond price.  So my yield is ($1000/$6,000) = .1666666. 

If I bought the bond at a premium, let’s say $10,300. My yield is lower. ($1000/$10300) = .097

So if interest rates are expected to rise due to inflation, bond prices are going to drop? Thus bond yields will go up?

And if interest rates go down, bond prices rise, and yields decrease?

4500,investing,sxrg,"Hello,

Like the title says, I am curious about how the futures rollovers work particularly in the context of ES and NQ.

I see it appears that contracts for the next quarter begin trading today (9/9/21) for Dec expiry contracts. But that doesn't mean the contracts expiring next week have stopped trading. When does the ""roll"" for trading normally compete for Sept contracts? A week before expiry (ie tomorrow, Friday), or Wednesday before expiry..?

Were contracts for Dec and further forward expiry already trading prior to today or no?

Is the typical effect on the price as the contract expiration nears convergence to spot? Is it not the case that everyone who does not intend to actually take delivery will effectively begin to evaporate from the market as the expiration date nears? What's the last day for which those who do not intend to take delivery actively trade?(assuming T-1 to expiry but not sure)

My financial advisor (a good friend, but I don't pay him for advice) suggests I move about half of what I have in that asset class into several large cap funds to lock in some gain and provide some stability against interest rate increase and inflation fears.

I have plenty of faith in the guy, he would never intentionally lead me wrong (since he doesn't get any money for this advice), but it got me thinking about whether his advice is based on sound reasoning.

4587,investing,JonDyna965,"Seeing the current situation, I strongly believe that the demand for copper will just keep on rising, so the prices will also rise unless we find more copper or some other economic alternative.

This brings me to the question about the possibility of the supply to meet the demand. Copper is important for the production of electronic devices and of renewable sources of energy. To add to that, it is also important for everything that’s electric, manufacturing batteries, and even for solar panels. There is a high demand for it and it is unlikely that it will go down soon.

There are a lot of big mining companies that are producing massive amounts of copper such as Codelco. Just last year, Codelco was the largest producer of copper, producing 1.73 million tonnes, which was 1.3% higher than their last year’s performance. BHP, which owns the world’s largest copper mine, comes in second producing 1.77 million tonnes.

A lot of smaller companies are joining as well too, and are in for producing tons of the metal too as shown by their drilling results. I believe that these smaller and new companies will contribute greatly to the copper supply boost, which will also help ease the situation of the rising prices.

Among them is Three Valley Copper ([TVC.V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tvc.v/)), a Canadian company producing pure copper cathodes from its mineral reserves. They recently released their second-quarter results, where they announced that they were able to mine 178,105 tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.50% from Don Gabriel. The company expects high unit costs throughout the year until next year since they are aiming to operate below capacity until Papomono Masivo is in full production.

As years go by, I believe copper is going to be really critical and will be a mainstay in a lot of industries. I know that a lot of companies are striving to meet the demand for this metal, but if it does not match the rate of the increase on demand for copper, the supply will likely be short and the prices will continue to increase.",The demand for copper against the copper supply,1631270936

But these investments are the major forces leasing to the main crises at least since 1870.

When France economy was starting getting weak in the middle of XIX century they invested in modernising Paris is a huge scale. It workerd to attract investment and to create demand for business but eventually it lead to the late 1860s crises resulting the the famous Paris Commune. The war against Bismark's Prussia was an other way to attempt to invest the eccess of capital.

The very same strategy was the urban development in NY and other major cities in America leading and the property crisis in the midle of 1920s preciding the big economic crash.

The  american suburb development in the 1940s excluding minorities, especially the black community,  and the bored suburb middle class kids, lead the 68 protests.

After changes in the economy for a more Neoliberal strategy, giving much more power to capitalists acumulation investments in urban development became more frequent and so the cycle of crisis.

The crisis of 1973 originated in a global property market crash; it wasn't really the oil prices as mainstream economics like to suggest. The property crash happen 6 months before the oil price hike and recession was well under way by the fall.

Commercial property lead the Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s in the US.

The end of Japan boom in 1990 corresponded to a collapse of land prices.

Nationalisation of Swedish banking system in 1992 because of eccess in property markets.

One of the teiggers for the collapse in East and South East Asia in 1997-98 was the eccessive urban development in Thailand.

Since urbain development have been intensified in the past 20 years I assume that keeping an eye on the property market is a good idea as a sinal for major crisis approaching.

The greater the share of property markets in GDP, the more significant the connection between financing and investment in the built environment becomes a major source of macro crisis.

#### Now, a few words on the criteria I’m using and sources of data.

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *– The stock has an excellent track  record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering  the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced  volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to  maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past  performance is just an indication — not a guarantee — we believe this  fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative  to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):

*TheStreet Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total  return potential over a 12-month period including both price  appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell  ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a  general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our  model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective***  *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities  market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and  forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of  past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so  we’re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The  Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company  earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and  earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s  shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the  market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500’s +10.6% .*

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*“A” Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has  an excellent track record for providing strong performance with  lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents  good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past  performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this  stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative  to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a  down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the  equivalent of a “****Strong Buy****“.*

*“B” rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good  track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While  the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our  opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for  outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a  down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a “****Buy****“.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts.  Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should  be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. Piotroski F-Score**

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects  nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company’s financial  situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency.  Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from gurufocus.

**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental**  stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated  above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My  requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of  at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [t](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean)heir website:

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores  (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric.  This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating  stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely  to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish  case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

I hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this  stock selection and the strategy? Feel free to leave a comment below.

**Synopsis**

As Bitcoin creates waves, our team steps back to examine the origins of the cryptocurrency. Read our whitepaper to gain an in-depth understanding of the technology and it’s applicability.

In the last 10 years, concepts like blockchain and digital currencies have moved from small online communities to being supported by some of the world’s largest firms. These concepts and ideas were best presented by Satoshi Nakamoto in the creation of Bitcoin. With the rise in popularity, and the different offerings, MNP found it necessary to investigate what Bitcoin implementation best fits Nakamoto’s original vision.

Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” sets the stage for our analysis. Nakamoto’s whitepaper, emails, forum posts, and original source code define the protocol — the rule set for Bitcoin as a data network — and the key elements that make Bitcoin a functional technology. Along with the whitepaper, we reviewed the publicly available emails, forum posts, and original code left by Nakamoto. We used these source materials to determine what Nakamoto’s original purpose for Bitcoin was – a global electronic cash system (that works peer-to-peer), while also laying the foundation for a network that can support more advanced data applications.

Using the sources mentioned above, we developed an assessment framework and related criteria assessing the relevance of the Bitcoin scripting language (including OpCodes incorporated in it), protocol elements, and capabilities in current implementations — Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) against Nakamoto’s original vision.

Our findings indicate that BSV is most representative of Nakamoto’s original intention and design for Bitcoin. One key factor is because the BSV blockchain demonstrates the ability to scale to support significant volumes of transactions in a timely manner for macro-payments and even micropayments, resulting from BSV’s “Genesis” hard fork in February 2020. This removed any arbitrary cap on block size and allows the BSV blockchain and transaction capacity to grow unbounded, while also removing state restrictions limits and improving the code base to allow for unbounded scaling. In addition, the Genesis hard fork restored key aspects of the original functionality of Bitcoin script, the programming language used within the Bitcoin protocol. In our whitepaper, we also identify what technology capabilities can be enabled once Nakamoto’s vision for Bitcoin has been fully realized.

A general outline of report is as follows:

* The Bitcoin Whitepaper
* Nakamoto’s known Forum Posts, Emails
* The Original Bitcoin Protocol
   * Capabilities
   * Critical components
   * Non-functional requirements
   * Implementation attributes
* Comparison of current Bitcoin implementations to Nakamoto’s original vision
* Impact of Nakamoto’s vision once fully realized.

4612,investing,fahrenheitc,"Redbubble is an ASX-Listed online marketplace for independent artists that provides printed products. Here was there recent investor presentation. Most of their customers are based in North America amd Europe. They are currently heavily undervalued at around $1.1B AUD ($800M USD).

https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02408798-3A573176?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4

The company currently has aggressive plans to grow their revenue to $1.5B AUD by 2024, afterwards focusing more efforts on raising margins. Their CAGR for the past 5 years has been 41% on average. Guidance until 2024 is around 20-30% CAGR. Their current revenue is around $657M AUD with a gross profit of $223M AUD. 

Here are some of their key selling points. 

Their business is being pushed by 3 key trends: a) they are an emerging winner in a rapidly shifting landscape (personalisation of e-commerce goods), b) this is reinforcing the inherent flywheel (network) effects and c) the shift to e-commerce and online has been accelerated by COVID - this is a structural change, we aren't going back

They have a very strong balance sheet and a nice cash buffer ($99M). They are cash flow positive, generating $51M EBITDA for FY21. 

The valuation multiple is still extremely low and enticing at circa 2x MP revenue, compared to comparators at 10x revenue or more. 

I want to emphasise the comparison between Etsy here because their business model is inherently similar, utilizing the incredibly rare flywheel effect between artists and customers. Their growth rate is also very similar. At current revenue, my estimates would put them at 3-4 years behind Etsy. 

Etsy Revenue (USD)

2015 - 273M 
2016 - 364M
2017 - 441M
2018 - 603M
2019 - 818M
2020 - 1.7B

Redbubble Revenue (AUD). 

2019 - 306M
2020 - 416M
2021 - 657M
2024 - 1.5B Target

Etsy's has appreciated 25x over the past 4-5 years. Not only did Etsy's valuation increase with its revenues, but also its revenue multiple too. The current difference in valuation between Etsy and RBL is around 37x. 

Mostly because RBL is listed on the ASX and relatively unknown globally (yet). Also because Australian funds are typically value investors. OTCMKTS is RDBBY. 

The Australian Tech scene is actually fairly well developed with Atlassian, Afterpay and Xero. Redbubble is shaping up to be the next giant, currently with a very attractive valuation that could yield significant returns in the upcoming years as they start to get noticed by the big NASDAQ players.","ASX: RBL.

4620,investing,ahmaddaud," Exhibiting in London today and featured on CoinMarketCap; if you haven't been introduced to DFL- Supercup sponsor Caizcoin just yet, it's high time to learn it's merits. It's big, it's bold and it's a revolution for many.

I've held back from posting about this currency up until now mainly due to two reasons:

* I don't believe in posting the ""merits"" of something until I am confident enough to invest in it myself
* In the Crypto-sphere you need approach new projects with caution lest they turn out to be over-hyped, or worse, scams

Yet, I have never felt so comfortable writing about a project as I do this one, with both those reasons flung out the window - and soon you will see why this is a great opportunity present.

### What is Caizcoin?

Access the whitepaper [here](https://member.caizcoin.com/white-paper).

Caizcoin's ""developer team collaborated closely with worldwide scholars, famous economists, business professionals, and IT experts to create Caizchain, an innovative blockchain"" (CMC, 2021). It features:

* low transaction fees,
* a distributed ledger,
* a top-notch consensus algorithm,
* and transaction speeds that outperform all current blockchains
* user-intuitive interface,
* extensively tested its API on different factors to assure high-quality performance and scalability

&amp;#x200B;

The added kick? It appeals to a vast population of Muslims who are in pursuit of 'Islamic Compliant Finance' for their investments- notably, gamble and interest free.

It is estimated that 20 to 30% of Muslim majority countries, from the Middle East and South Asia exclusively participate in 'Islamic finance' as a pose to conventional financial products which often have attached mechanisms of interest. The market for this project is certainly there.

&amp;#x200B;

### Why CAIZ?

The Crypto industry is volatile - that's no secret - but throw in a mix of malicious actors and rug-pulls, there is further dissuasion in participating or adopting. Notably however, on CoinMarketCap, the Caizcoin project is designed in a way to:

&gt;*...to create a moral platform will be highly advantageous to small investors looking for secure investments. The Caiz team has stated on several occasions that their creative financial solution will assist the Muslim crypto community in multiplying the returns on their investments and that it will be beneficial to everybody, regardless of their background or religious affiliation. - CMC, 2021*

What is key to note here is that the **project seeks to extend itself to all realms of society,** and what is NOT is a project exclusively for Muslims. That is it's focal point but the investment opportunity is there for all individuals regardless of religion or nationality.

&amp;#x200B;

My main investing account is with another brokerage but I decided to set up a mini side portfolio with Robinhood (I know there are issues with Robinhood but it will work fine for what I'm doing). Since I want the majority of my money going towards my main account, I came up with a budget for my situation that will pretty much be unnoticeable in terms of DCA.

I am starting with $100 and splitting it evenly between AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA so $20 on each of them. Then I'm setting a recurring investment of $1 for each of them weekly so $5/week or around $22/month. So it's pretty much the cost of a streaming service monthly. 

I back tested this scenario and was surprised to see how much it actually grew - from the initial $100 to $43.5k over the last 10yrs with just adding $22/month! I'm not expecting these companies to continue at the same growth rate moving forward but I am happy with my picks and obviously it can be adjusted based on preferences but I thought you all might like to see this scenario especially if you're young and don't have a lot of capital to put in.

I read about call/put options here all the time, but I've never once seen anyone mention more ""exotic"" derivatives like Knock Out warrants (which I discovered through my broker recently).

I'm curious if people don't use them because they feel they're an inferior choice, because their broker simply doesn't have them and they haven't heard of them, or another reason.

(In simple terms, A KO C 12/99 warrant is like a call option that doesn't have a time limit, doesn't have time or volatility value (no greeks), but does have a KO limit where the whole contract is void if the underlying ever once crosses that point.

For example, a KO warrant on the S&amp;P 500 index with a KO limit of 4400 would be worth around $1 at the moment because the index is at around 4500. If it rises to 4600, the warrant is worth around $2, doubling the investment while the underlying moves 2% (note that this is exponential (flattening, not parabolic) because basically 4400 is the new 0 and the stock is now 200 instead of 100), while if it dipped to 4399 = game over.)

Seeing as you trade one kind of risk (KO) for another (Time decay / No volatility), but the profit potential is much higher than with regular calls (if going for a KO limit close to the current price, not otherwise but then it becomes pretty safe instead), I'm fairly intrigued and will try it out soon.

Hi everyone!

I would like to tell you about my experience of investing in P2P lending platforms.

During my studies in the EU, my fellow students introduced me to the investments in P2P lending platforms.

2019 was the year of the lowest interest rates on deposits in the EU- fluctuated around 0.5-1% per annum, and this has been around for more than 2 years.

While all of them were receiving interest rates 20 times higher than in banks.

Everything got to the point that my fellow students, being EU citizens, began to take loans in banks and invest these funds in these microloans.

Sounds crazy, but it works for now.

I decided to try.

Having invested 8K, in 18 months I received 1258 Euros of income, which amounted to about 10.5% per annum.

After moving back to the United States, I discovered new opportunities with Prosper.

It was a terrible experience.

On Mintos, I was not limited in the amount of investment, and most importantly, I did not have any time limits, since the vast majority of loans were microloans for a short period (up to 2 months).

But in Prosper, you could invest for a period starting from 36 months, and the fee could reach up to 2%, in Mintos it is fixed at 0.85%.

In the end, I was refused because I could not show my gross income over 80.000 $ Plus.

Also, there was no secondary market on Prosper where you could quickly and with a premium resell your investment.

Fortunately, I still have a European SEPA bank account in Euros and continue to invest in Mintos.

Of course, the system is not perfect:

1) You can earn more than 12% (the maximum that can be earned on the platform is 30% per annum), but then you get into loans with a rating of C- and below, and defaults can sometimes reach more than 30%.

After all, the risk is all yours!

2) When transferring money to a European bank from the United States, after I left the EU, I had slight difficulties.

My payment was frozen by the bank due to suspected money laundering. I had to submit documents on the origin of money through the Bank of America, and explain why, being in the USA and being a US citizen, I transfer money to a European bank, and for what purposes it will be used. It is good that they did not demand to obtain a license for investment activities.

3) When converting from Dollars to Euros and from Euros to Dollars, you have to lose up to 4%.

From now on, I intend to increase my investment to 20K dollars, I will continue to invest in Mintos, and also try a new platform that uses crypt and promises interest rates two times higher than the European one.  


I will try to write monthly reports.

However, I can’t seem to find any overall guides for newer investors like myself for “non-retirement” investments. Obviously the goal across the board is to be financially stable when it comes to retirement time but I also want to be able to learn the market and see actual returns based on what I’ve learned. Every guide I come across seems to be just investing for retirement but I want to learn more than just that. Some of you may say just have it all go to retirement and forget about it but again, I want to learn and see if I can’t create profits for myself. I’ve done some basic research and am already investing with a diverse portfolio but I want to take it up a notch and really start to analyze these companies deeper for future gains.

Are these type of guides out there that don’t go directly towards a typical retirement account?",Investing guides for non-retirement investors?,1631050895

Third quarter of fiscal 2022:

Total revenues are expected to be $177.0 to $178.0 million.
Subscription revenues are expected to be $158.0 to $159.0 million.
Professional services and other revenues are expected to be approximately $19.0 million.

Non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated is expected to be $0.27 to $0.29 per share.
Diluted weighted average share count is expected to be approximately 76.5 million shares.
Coupa has not reconciled its expectations for non-GAAP income from operations to GAAP loss from operations, or non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated to GAAP net loss per share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated because certain items excluded from non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated, such as charges related to stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, gain or loss on conversion of convertible senior notes, the adjustment attributable to non-controlling interests, and related tax effects, including non-recurring income tax adjustments, cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. In addition, the effect of the anti-dilutive impact of the capped call transactions entered into in connection with the company's offerings of convertible notes in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. The effect of these items may be significant.

&gt;SHANGHAI, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Bonds issued by indebted developer China Evergrande Group [**(3333.HK)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/3333.HK) slumped on Monday after a ratings downgrade led to restrictions on their use as collateral, prompting China's stock exchanges to halt trade.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Shanghai Stock Exchange said in a statement that it had temporarily suspended trading in China Evergrande Group's 6.98% July 2022 corporate bond following ""abnormal fluctuations."" The exchange had also suspended trading in the bond on Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Shanghai exchange data showed the bonds sliding more than 25% to a low of 40.18 yuan after the resumption of trade on Monday afternoon. The company's 5.9% May 2023 Shenzhen-traded bond , which was also suspended, fell more than 35% after trading resumed.  
&gt;  
&gt;The slump in bond prices comes after a ratings downgrade erased the bonds' value for use in pledged repo trading.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rules governing pledged repos require bonds issued after April 7, 2017 and pledged as collateral to be rated AAA, while issuers must have credit ratings of AA or higher. Bonds issued before that date - including Evergrande's July 2022 bond - need only be rated AA or higher.  
&gt;  
&gt;China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co (CCXI) downgraded Evergrande and its onshore bonds to AA from AAA on Thursday, and placed the company and its bonds on a watchlist for further downgrades.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Friday, China Securities Depository and Clearing Co. (CSDC) reduced the ""conversion ratio"" of the July 2022 bond to zero, effective Sept. 7. Other Evergrande bonds were not included in CSDC's table of conversion ratios on Friday as they no longer qualified for inclusion.  
&gt;  
&gt;The conversion ratio determines leverage limits for repo financing given a specific bond pledged as collateral. CSDC is owned by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.  
&gt;  
&gt;A director at a local brokerage said that the reduction in the conversion ratio was a ""grey rhino"" - a highly obvious yet ignored threat. ""It was bound to happen.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Evergrande declined to comment. But in a statement on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Monday, it acknowledged the impact of the rating downgrade on the bonds' use as pledged repo collateral. It said the bonds had previously been deemed appropriate only for qualified institutional investors, and the downgrade had no impact on investor suitability.  
&gt;  
&gt;Worries surrounding Evergrande, which has been scrambling to raise funds to pay lenders and suppliers, have grown into broader concerns that a debt crisis could send shockwaves through China's banking system.",China Evergrande bonds suspended as prices plunge.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In a sign of how far China’s leaders  have drifted from their revolutionary roots, the biggest shock gripping  the country today is that the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) might  actually be socialist after all.  
&gt;  
&gt;The shakeup  centers on the phrase “common prosperity.” It was first introduced by  revolutionary leader Mao Zedong but has now been taken up as the  defining mantra of a new era as imagined by current strongman President  Xi Jinping.  
&gt;  
&gt;In an Aug. 17 speech to the CCP’s  Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs—his first since the  secretive, annual summer leadership conclave at the seaside town of  Beidaihe—Xi [declared](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-08/18/c_1310133051.htm)  that “Common prosperity is an essential requirement of socialism and a  key feature of Chinese-style modernization.” He used the phrase 15 times  in total in his address and it’s become a refrain ever since.  
&gt;  
&gt;[According](http://politics.people.com.cn/BIG5/n1/2021/0817/c1024-32197305.html) to the official *People’s Daily*,  the goal is to build a more egalitarian China by “expanding the  proportion of middle-income groups, increasing the incomes of low-income  groups, reasonably adjusting high incomes \[and\] banning illegal  incomes.” Nobody doubts that the CCP would also like to leverage common  prosperity to reassert its authority over China’s high-fliers.   
&gt;  
&gt;“These  billionaires and tech companies are very risky to the CCP because they  are seen as an alternative form of social and political power,” says  David Moser, associate dean of the Yenching Academy at Peking  University.  
&gt;  
&gt;  📷  An  investor watches an electric screen displaying stock price figures at a  stock exchange hall on February 18, 2021 in Shanghai, China. VCG/VCG via Getty Images)        
&gt;  
&gt;In response, skittish  investors have started dumping their stock. Up to $1 trillion has been  wiped off the valuation of Chinese firms since February, after  regulators began targeting electronic payment providers, real estate  developers, private tuition companies (a vast, $120 billion industry in  education-hungry China) and the gaming sector. The latter—a giant and  highly lucrative market generating $44 billion in earnings last year—is  now reeling from new directives banning children from playing more than  three hours of online games a week.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s the  biggest socio-economic change since reformist leader Deng Xiaoping  unleashed market forces in the late 1970s. In words that have since  become infamous, Deng propelled the country’s export-driven resurgence  with the exhortation: “Let some people get rich first.” Many forget that  he went on to say that those allowed to achieve wealth would be  expected to “lead other regions and people to gradually achieve common  prosperity.” His successors now look poised to make good on the bargain.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Read more:** [*What the Crackdown on China’s Tech Firms Is Really About*](https://time.com/6079877/china-ipo/)  
&gt;  
&gt;A senior CCP official [said last month](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3146438/chinas-common-prosperity-push-does-not-mean-killing-rich)  that “common prosperity” does not mean “killing the rich to help the  poor.” But rumors are swirling that Beijing may bring in property,  inheritance, and capital gains taxes to level the playing field in a  society where the top 1% now control 31% of wealth, according to Credit  Suisse—up from 21% two decades ago. The preferential 10% tax rate  enjoyed by internet companies is also expected to be rolled back in  favor of the standard 25% corporate rate.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Xi is  saying, ‘Hey, I found the magic sauce,'” explains Sung Wen-Ti, a  scholar specializing in the CCP leadership at the Australian National  University. “‘I’m going to continue to use this socialist market economy  to encourage economic growth, while redistributing wealth in a way that  doesn’t lead us back to the Mao Zedong days of poverty.’”

&gt;  
&gt;The meaning of common prosperity  
&gt;  
&gt;In July, [to mark the CCP’s centenary](https://time.com/6077358/china-communist-party-centenary-xi-jinping/),  Xi announced that the goal of building “a moderately prosperous society  in all respects” was complete, having already declared [absolute poverty eradicated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-56194622#:~:text=Chinese%20President%20Xi%20Jinping%20says,been%20lifted%20out%20of%20poverty.).  By 2049, the centenary of the People’s Republic, the goal is to “build a  modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic,  culturally advanced and harmonious.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course,  “democratic” means different things in China than it does in the West,  but there’s no doubt that the goal of a “socialist country” is more  important to Xi than it was to his immediate predecessors. So far,  celebrities who flaunt their wealth and welch on taxes have found  themselves abruptly taken off the Chinese internet. Officials have also [announced](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008371/beijings-top-teachers-will-rotate-shifts-across-schools)  the ramping up of a scheme to rotate the best teachers among different  schools in order to equalize education standards. Ride-hailing firm Didi  and e-commerce platform JD.com have meanwhile moved to establish trade  unions for their staff, who until now have typically been employed  casually via third-party contractors, receiving paltry benefits. But the  central government has offered little specific guidance as to what  socialism and common prosperity mean in practice.   
&gt;  
&gt;The  vagueness mirrors an anti-corruption drive started by Xi in 2012.  Instead of new laws and regulations to ensure transparency and  accountability, that purge instead borrowed from the ancient Chinese  tactic of “kill a chicken to scare the monkeys,” says Moser—making an  example of [1.5 million officials](https://www.efe.com/efe/english/world/china-punishes-more-than-1-5-million-officials-for-corruption/50000262-3412841), a comparatively small number, to send a clear message to all 90 million apparatchiks that graft was no longer tolerated.  
&gt;  
&gt;This  is the context in which China’s wealthiest have been left to interpret  the implications of common prosperity for themselves. Unsurprisingly,  they have been throwing money at the problem, pouring billions into  charitable foundations as a gesture of appeasement.

&gt;  
&gt;On Thursday, Jack Ma’s e-commerce giant Alibaba [pledged](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/alibaba-pledges-15-5-billion-to-xi-s-common-prosperity-drive?sref=KQ64K3tR&amp;mc_cid=4a3df73e6c&amp;mc_eid=1f68a91ab9)  100 billion renminbi ($15.5 billion) to fund common prosperity  initiatives until 2025. That came on top of an earlier pledge of 100  billion renminbi from Tencent, and 10 billion renminbi from bosses at  each of Pinduoduo, Xiaomi and Meituan, for various social projects.  Alibaba had already been in the spotlight after regulators fined the  firm $2.8 billion and nixed the $37 billion IPO of its fintech arm, Ant  Group, which was subsequently ordered to restructure. Notably, the  firm—along with several of China’s most profitable corporations—is based  in Zhejiang province, chosen as “a demonstration zone for achieving  common prosperity,” [according](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-06/10/c_1310001320.htm) to the official Xinhua news agency.

gotta say I really liked what I found, and I think it could be a great long-term investment opportunity... but still wanted to hear people's thoughts about $DKNG. (I posted full analysis with pictures and more data at r/growthstonks)

# THE ONLINE BETTING industry 

The market is worth $67 billion today and is estimated to reach about $93 billion by 2023—growing at roughly 11.5% per annum.

There are few reasons for the aggressive growth, First, more of our activities are taking place online, a trend that extends to betting as well.

The second is regulation. The U.S. Supreme Court uplifted the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in May of 2018 to legalize sports betting on a federal level. Since then, 25 states have legalized sports betting.

# SPORTS BETTING

The most popular activity by far is [sports betting](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/americas-multi-billion-dollar-sports-betting-industry/), which makes up over 40% of the total online betting market.

# DraftKings

DraftKings is a *sports betting*, *daily fantasy sports contest*, and an *iGaming* operator.

In total, DraftKings now operates sportsbooks in **14 states** and averages **1.5 million monthly unique paying customers** across its online sportsbooks, iGaming, and daily fantasy offerings.

# Financials

DraftKings's revenue keeps surging YOY, in Q2-2021 revenue reached $297,605M which is a 22% higher sales compared to the analyst expectations. last year the company delivered $74,998M in revenue.

The company also said that it had grown the number of monthly unique payers by 281% and the average revenue per monthly unique payer by 26%. In other words, fundamental growth was very strong.

Even though I really think that the potential for growth here is clear, the company still losing a lot of money, Cost of revenue spiked this quarter to $187,006M from $53,172M, and new loss reached $305,526M - even more than DraftKings's revenue.

Another positive point in DraftKings's favor is the amount of cash the company has gathered since 2018. The company currently has $2.65 billion in cash, which compared to last year's results - $1.24 billion, is a 113% change.

I live in the US. The organization I wish to invest in is in another country, specifically in the South East Asia region. I want to emphasize that I lived most of my life in that country and I am aware of how the economy is in general.

E-sports is a growing community and I am a ""gamer"" myself as well as a hobby streamer.

Now, I sent a message to this growing organization telling them that I wish to invest. I wish to invest $1000 minimum which is a big amount when converted into that country's currency. I can invest more but I wish to know more about the company itself before committing.

Now, once I get their attention and we set up a meeting, what information do I ask for them to ensure that I get my ROI?

I looked up a few things online and I thought about the following:

\- Mission and Vision

\- Projections in 5 years

\- Plans and Projects in the future if they can disclose them to me

\- Organizational Chart (Who owns the business and how long they've been in the industry)

\- Legal needs on how we can secure my investment

What information should I ask on their end? What information should I also give them? Emphasizing that I only wish to give financial investments. But I can also give them access to materials here in the US that are not available in the SEA regions since I have connections with a trusted Freight Forwarder.

Now, I am aware that I may need to go back to that country. But due to covid restrictions I may not be able to. Really appreciate any thoughts on this matter, everyone. Been a reader on this subreddit for a bit now.",I want to invest on an esports organization. Thoughts?,1630940555

4829,investing,GadnukBreakerOfWrlds,"**This might be good news after the rout in China tech since Feb 2021. There was a lot of uncertainty whether China is shutting itself off from foreign capital and how it could lead to delisting of ADRs like BABA, BIDU, JD, PDD, NIO, etc. But I guess they won't be turning their heads away from foreign investors anytime soon.**

BEIJING, Sept 6 (Reuters) - China will further open its capital markets to foreign investors, the country's top securities regulator said on Monday, adding that it will pursue pragmatic cross-border cooperation to regulate overseas-listed Chinese companies.

Global investors have been spooked in recent months by a flurry of Chinese regulations targeting sectors ranging from technology to private tutoring. U.S. plans to kick non-compliant Chinese firms off American exchanges has fuelled concern.

""Opening-up and cooperation is the inevitable trend in the integrated development of global capital markets,"" China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Yi Huiman told a conference organised by the World Federation of Exchanges.

China is studying further measures, including expanding the scope of the stock connect scheme linking China and Hong Kong and improving the Shanghai-London Stock Connect program, Yi said in a speech posted on CSRC's website.

Meanwhile, CSRC will conduct ""pragmatic"" cooperation in areas such as supervision of overseas-listed Chinese companies, cross-border auditing and law enforcement, he added.

Yi said that given interwoven global markets, governments should abandon the mentality of a ""zero-sum game"", as companies and investors share both the boom and the doom.

Global financial centres should facilitate cross-border financing, ""rather than become the platforms and tools governments use to sanction other countries"", Yi said, without mentioning the United States.

Yi's speech came a day after CSRC vice chairman Fang Xinghai made similar pledges to further deregulate China's markets.

China will expand the channels for foreign capital to invest in Chinese securities and futures markets, and will further facilitate the issuance of yuan-denominated ""Panda bonds"" by foreign institutions, Fang told a separate conference on Sunday.

China will also improve domestic listing rules for overseas entities, as well as regulations on overseas listings of Chinese companies, Fang said in a speech also posted on CSRC's website.

Fang also vowed to safeguard Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre, saying that Beijing supports domestic companies listing in Hong Kong.

4852,investing,Octoberandseptember,"As COVID-19 wreaked havoc across the globe, putting countless businesses on the brink of collapse, it has also given birth to new business opportunities oriented to remote working. In fact, the pandemic-driven “Work-From-Home” economy has led to a growing number of unicorns – startups with valuations above $1 billion. According to CB Insights, in the first half of 2021 alone, 203 unicorns have emerged worldwide. 

As the total number of these unicorns has tipped to above 700 around the world, Taiwan is mooted to be one of those locations with a high potential to pump out world-class unicorns. Speaking at Connect 2021 (Link in Chinese), a leading Taiwanese tech forum co-organized by TechTaiwan, Google Taiwan’s former director Dr. Lee-Feng Chien offered his insight on Taiwan’s startup and investment environment, outlining the challenges faced by Taiwanese startups and the country’s significance to the global investment community. 

“Taiwan’s capital market has started paying attention to digital economy.”

At the moment, Taiwan already has three unicorns. The most prominent among them is Gogoro, a leading e-bike manufacturer that has been expanding its presence in the US, Europe and India. Another unicorn is 91APP, a software company that facilitates small merchants to launch e-commerce apps. The third unicorn, Appier, is an AI software company founded in 2012, counting among its investors SoftBank Group and Temasek Holding, and has recently gone public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, raising  US$130 million. In fact, Appier is the first Taiwanese company to be listed in Japan since 1998.


Lee-Feng Chien, former Managing Director of Google Taiwan. Source: TechTaiwan

“The success of 91APP signifies that Taiwan’s capital market has started paying attention to digital economy, willing to give it a higher valuation,” observed Chien who, in his time as Google Taiwan’s director, oversaw its foundation from scratch, and eventually made it Google’s largest hardware R&amp;D hub outside of the US. By introducing three data centers, Google also laid the foundation of Taiwan’s data economy. 

“Appier’s listing means that Taiwanese startups have the capability to make it abroad,” Chien commented, expressing his optimism toward Taiwanese startup scene’s recent developments. According to the Google veteran, if more startups can expand beyond Taiwan as Appier has done before, it will be a boost to Taiwan’s digital economy. Constrained by the size of real economy though, startups in the digital economy sector have so far accounted little in Taiwan’s GDP. 

The rise of super-unicorn startups

The wave of digital transformation ushered in by the pandemic, however, is regarded by Chien as the opportunity of the decade for Taiwanese startups. He noted that COVID-19 altered the traditionally conservative investment strategy of private equity funds. As investment returns dropped, private equity funds have increasingly moved into venture capital investments. 

This latest development is simultaneously a challenge and a chance to Taiwan’s startup landscape: while it pushes unicorn startups to the forefront of post-pandemic global economic revival by funnelling in the surplus in the capital market, creating so-called “super-unicorns” valued above US$10 billion in the process, it also diverts investments away from early-stage startups. 

“It is the best time to fundraise for startups, but not necessarily for launching them,” Chien observed. Under these circumstances, he pointed out that in addition to the home market, Taiwanese startups would have to secure at least one overseas market , just like Appier did, to attract the global capital market. The internet-based digital world, he observed, could lower the threshold with its borderless nature, and Chien considered it a must for Taiwanese unicorns to engage with this platform to expand its horizon. 

However, Chien also set his sight beyond digital economy, considering its growth peak to be over and competition already too fierce. Instead, he identified space, especially the satellite industry, to be the likelier sectors from which the next unicorns will emerge.",After Covid-19: Former Google Taiwan Director Foresees Super-Unicorn Startups,1630980145

Here is the meat and potatoes of the law:

&gt;*Art. 1.* The purpose of this law is to regulate bitcoin as unrestricted legal tender with liberating power, unlimited in any transaction, and to any title that public or private natural or legal persons require carrying out.  
&gt;  
&gt;What is mentioned in the previous paragraph does not hinder the application of the Monetary Integration law.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 2.* The exchange rate between bitcoin and the United States dollar, subsequently USD, will be freely established by the market.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 3.* Prices may be expressed in bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 4.* Tax contributions can be paid in bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 5.* Exchanges in bitcoin will not be subject to capital gains tax, just like any legal tender.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 6.* For accounting purposes, the USD will be used as the reference currency.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Art. 7.*** **Every economic agent must accept bitcoin as payment when offered to him by whoever acquires a good or service.**  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 8.* Without prejudice to the actions of the private sector, the State shall provide alternatives that allow the user to carry out transactions in bitcoin and have automatic and instant convertibility from bitcoin to USD if they wish. Furthermore, the State will promote the necessary training and mechanisms so that the population can access bitcoin transactions.

This isn't just making Bitcoin legal tender as some publicity stunt/gimmick, it's full on requiring that ""every economic agent must accept Bitcoin as payment"" as mentioned in Article #7. 

This is a bold move for El Salvador and a big milestone for Bitcoin. How do you think this will work out for El Salvador over the coming years? Will other countries follow?

4895,investing,Cool-Statement-6959,"Just last month, Guillermo Lasso, the president of Ecuador, issued Decree 151 which focuses on a new mining policy, strengthening the government’s support towards mining as a key driver of the economy.

According to this [article](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/canadian-miners-welcome-decree-in-ecuador-2021-08-09), “The decree lays out a clear action plan and timeframe that has a primary objective of developing an efficient, environmentally and socially responsible mining industry in Ecuador, to promote national and foreign investment and to implement the best practices for the exploitation of these resources.”

To be honest, I am not surprised by this knowing how supportive the president is when it comes to bringing in more investors to the country. He has his background since he was a former banker and knows how important it is to bring in investors to improve the economy.

Because of this new decree, the activities of mining companies will improve even more. Just recently, Solaris Resources’ ([SLSSF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLSSF/community/)) Warintza project produced some results, with the initial hole at East was drilled to a total depth of 1,213m with assays reported for the first 320m of core returning 0.46% of CuEq from the surface, including 54 meters of 0.70% CuEq. This is only the beginning though since the company plans to focus on resource expansion. They have been performing really well lately, despite that recent dip a few weeks back.

SolGold ([SOLG.L](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/solg.l/)), another mining company whose mines are located in Ecuador, also released its regional exploration update. Their Hole 1 at Varela is testing underneath outcropping porphyry-style vein stockworks which returned encouraging surface rock-saw channel sample results of 99m @ 0.34% CuEq including 25.1m @ 0.58% CuEq. 

But along with the decree is the promise of responsible mining and the inclusivity of the local community. Hopefully, these mining companies will stay true to their own projects of involving the local communities in these mines and making sure that there will be no over-exploitation of mineral resources. After all, the mining industry will definitely affect Ecuador’s economy in a positive way, the same way it helped its neighboring countries in South America.",The new mining policy in Ecuador and how will it affect the country,1631017311

TLDR; how to find undervalued stocks by comparing the 11 sectors and small, medium and large market cap companies. 

First I have a yahoo finance chart that tracks the baseline s&amp;p 500 and then inside of that I create 11 more lines inside of that that track the different sectors. This lets you see if money is flowing from tech into the utility sector. 

That happened to me early this year. It helped me spot it before it came out in the news! I didn’t shift my money from my tech stocks to utilities because I wanted to hold. But I understood what was going on before most people and didn’t stress it. 

Also the article breaks down why comparing the s&amp;p small, medium and large caps will allow you to see that right now the large and mid cap s&amp;p aren’t undervalued. The s&amp;p 600 small cap is showing me that there may be an opportunity for solid gains.

I have recently been interested in Morningstar’s ETF rating system which has been a popular tool used for ranking ETFs and i wanted to do an experiment or judging of sorts on this system because picking the correct ETF for long term investing and sustainability is extremely important especially with compounded growth, dividend reinvestment, and the fact that most people can not the spend the time I did and usually can just spend a little time looking at articles or have to listen to financial advisors for ETF recommendation which may not always be the best idea considering not all of your financial advisors incentives are/will be aligned with yours. I have personal experience with this considering my father who has cash that needs to be invested in his 401k and also my grandparents which are aiming for sustainability in their portfolio allowing for them not to worry too much about their withdrawal percentage each year.


To start it off, You are able to check on Morningstar to see all of their 5 star ratings on ETFs which have varying risk return ratios

I have done the arduous task of narrowing down and categorizing these ETFs in their sector both identified by Morningstar and by different preferences.

In my first wave of narrowing, I searched up each ETF and looked at the 5 year price history, other analyst rating available besides Morningstar, dividend yields (relative to expectation and ETF type), Morningstar risk/return ratings, and long term sector/industry outlook for the respective ETFs.

From the about 140 5-star ETFs rated by Morningstar, only 91 remain from the previous criteria mentioned.

I then categorized the remaining 91 ETFs into their categories for comparison between sector ETFs to find which are the best picks:

4968,investing,Spinkis,"Neonode a 54m$ Mcap owns 50% of a court case against APPLE and SAMSUNG with infringment on roughly 4 000 000 000 products. 
1 dollar/unit would give #NEON 173$ per share - closed yesterday @ 5,17

How is this possible and what are the odds? 

Neonode owns the patent to the swipe technology and launched the first touchscreen phone in 2002.

The phone had small success at the time and the company changed focus.

In the great patent war between #AAPL and #SMSN 2016 Samsung overturned a huge verdict based on patent invalidity.

From the ruling: Samsung presented two prior art references, the NeoNode N1 Quickstart Guide (“Neonode”) from 2004 and a video and paper by Plaisant that were presented at a computer-human-interactivity conference in 1992. “We reverse the judgment of infringement and no invalidity because the asserted claim of the ’721 patent would have been obvious in light of Neonode and Plaisant.

New management in Neonode contacted IP specialists Aequitas in 2019 to se if they had a case against Apple and Samsung. In 2020 they filed suit for IP Infringment on patent 993 and 879

Samsung and Apple joined suit and challanged the patent in sept 2020 in IPR - this process will either nullify the patent or give the Neonode side a huge win.

They used the same tacticts as samsung aginst apple - Prior art in other patents.

The IPR Board agreed on one patent 993 - the Patent is up for discussion. 879 stands! To be made unvalid on grounds of earlier patents A/S argues:
Combination of Hisatomi / Ren or Hansen / Gillespie

Hisatomi 2002-02-20
Ren 2000/09
Hansen 1998-10-13
GIllespi 2002-04-17

Neonode have invention date 2002-12-19.It turns out have Neon had an ace up their sleeve.

Yesterday Neonode filed for discovery in Sweden and questioning of the inventor Magnus Goertz.

They searched for the originals of 3 documents already in their posseion all proving the invention took place around May 2001. This kills Apple/Samsungs prior art argument and makes the Patent stand on merit.

And for the trial and Jury in texas they want another document:
The signed licensdeal with samsung from 2005 that samsung never paid.All documentation from discussion about licensing with APPLE from 2005-2010
These documents will prove the value of the technology in 2005 - probably higher then 1 $ per unit?

They will also prove without doubt that Apple and Samsung knew about the infringment

IF IPR stands their will be a Jury trial in Texas for Judge Allan albright or settlement

How do you think a Jury would react to the licensing deal?

Or samsungs defence against apple that the patent is owned på Neonode and NOT paying them a cent?

The optics of this case is spectacular and the risk reward extreme.Neonode is a company now producing touchless touch for elevators and kiosks. It is just ramping up after corona and probably will turn from loss to profit in 2022. The client list include NEC and Schindler.

The court case described above is a FREE OPTION at the current value... (Source: https://threader.app/thread/1433683270487658530)","Neonode, 54m$ Mcap owns 50% of a court case against APPLE and SAMSUNG with infringment on roughly 4 000 000 000 products.",1630914729

I saw some comments suggest keeping some dividends but concentrating the majority of their portfolio on growth stocks and in my opinion this seems like a good combination. 
I also saw someone saying that dividends in general are useless because of taxes, and how the dividend takes value out of the stock.

Ethereum is growing rapidly and currently sitting at nearly $4000 (\~2000% gain). The most popular NFT (CryptoPunks) have grown from $4000 last year to roughly $400,000.  That is a roughly 10,000% gain. I think you get the point.

""Value"" stocks like Ford and GM have gone up about 50% in the same time, a fraction of the growth stocks. Similarly, these value plays dropped 40% during the coronavirus crash, roughly the same as all risky assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. 

Which poses the question :: why would anyone buy stocks, especially growth stocks?

Everything Buffett and others eschew has essentially been thrown at the window. Now while one may have been focused on value and long term growth, their returns will have been essentially rooted to their peers who invested in growth. (ironic to call an unproductive asset like crypto ""growth"" but you get the point). So in logical times, you could say ""these are in a bubble and history does not repeat itself to the future."" however, considering the past 5 years crypto is up tremendously with little dips and currently sits at a $900b mc (btc), it could also be another 5 years it goes to $2t before it goes back down. So ""the long run"" point is vague and meritless.

Before the trade I had $32,000 margin buying power with about $11,000 non margin buying power on Friday. I made a purchase for about $8600 worth of stock X shares. Today my margin buying power is at a negative -$ 8,000 and non margin at a negative -$2,400. It’s clear that my cash buying power was used because I have $2,400 left to withdraw from the account. So why does the system spazz out even though I didn’t even use margin for the purchase and have over $20,000 equity in the account.

The company I work for was acquired by a private equity firm (PEF) - they went from a public company (shares was on the stock market) but they were all bought by the PEF.

Now a larger software based company (LSBC) has acquired them from the PEF - the LSBC isn't offering the staff shares as part of their benefits program as they own the entirety of the shares.

However, they are offering ""notes"" (and no, I don't know what that means) which I think might be a way to ""own"" shares whilst the company remains private, i.e. internally traded shares (?)

As you can tell, I have no idea what that means or how it works.

My question is, if the company grows massively and I own these so-called ""notes"" - what does that mean in terms of monetary value?

As sort of attempts to explain this would be appreciated.

People do not know what actual companies they own shares in, they just expect a crazy 7/8% return in a year. People will realize this, and eventually pull their money out, which could cause a chain reaction of stock prices dropping to the point where the whole economy could collapse. And if people do not realize, they still are subject to very unfortunate consequences if the stock market crashes from other bubbles like the tech bubble. With more people investing now than ever before, a crash could be 10x more brutal with nearly 50% of americans invested (20/30% of that being directly in index funds).

I also think the worst outcome we could see is the collapse of smaller businesses, since an index fund crash/pullout would hurt small businesses that receive a large part of their funding and have most company stock included in index funds. An index fund collapse could put a lot of small businesses out, but big business will survive and get even bigger. From a market analysis point that would say to invest in big business once it crashes, but from a morality stance some of these companies are already way too big (Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc).

Other people are getting into the game, creating coins and institutions are operating exchanges, where they trade and where people can ""stake."" (where they lend their coins out - to be used in other trades) and earn interest. **Everything is unregulated.**

90% of the trade volume is done through derivatives and options with crypto as the underlying asset.  
These has lead to a lot of price manipulation.

On these exchanges, they use stable coins to make purchases where the price is supposedly pegged 1 USD per stable coin. One in particular, tether, is the most popular stable coin, operating out of the Cayman islands. - completely deregulated. There has been scandal after scandal surrounding this stable coin as it is known they are not pegged 1 USD per stable coin however most of the trade volume is done using tether token. **Tether has a 66.5billion USD market cap and like 14 employees on linkedin... they are responsible for the majority of trading volume in the cryptocurrency space.**  
This one stable coin, there are others with the same issue.

So, FED has got wind of this industry and they are worried about the effect of stable coins on the entire financial industry. Essentially, they have evidence that the stable coins might collapse and trigger runs (massive sell offs or people trying to withdraw their money when the exchanges don't have enough money to pay them out). The industry is now operating on debt (through loans (staking) and exchanges taking major commercial loans to operate) and they have derivatives with multipliers. And it is all unregulated. 

So when the FED tapers and we see a 10% - 20% correction later in the fall. People are saying that will trigger a massive sell off in the entire financial industry. AND because there is an excessive amount of short positions in the financial industry (they're not talking about crypto industry).  Some are saying that it will trigger a bigger correction that 20%. 

Also the federal reserve has introduced crypto legislation in the infrastructure bill designed to tax crypto industry more vehemently. Saying that people (stakers, exchangers and miners) will simply not have the information needed to comply. 

That legislation will be signed hopefully end of September or October 1stish. Crypto enthusiasts claim it will forced many exchange to have to de list and re list. Crypto enthusiasts also say the way the law is written is too vague and so many in the industry will not have the ability to

President Biden’s budget calls for higher taxes on companies, and it’s simply a matter of time before it becomes law, thanks to the Democrats’ slim voting majority in the Senate. Even West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic moderate, appears to be on board, as long as the stimulus that the higher levies would help fund is paid for.

Don’t expect stocks to shrug off a tax increase. Bank of America strategist Ohsung Kwon estimates that a 25% corporate rate would cut 2022 earnings estimates by 5%, potentially erasing all of next year’s expected profit growth. The tech and health-care sectors, with a 7% decline, would take the biggest hit, while energy, real estate, and utilities, for the most part,would be unscathed.

For instance, the basket of stocks with little tax sensitivity includes Canadian National Railway (CNI), with no exposure to U.S. tax rates, while the more tax-sensitive basket includes CSX (CSX), a U.S.-based railroad company. In tech, the Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is paired with the more U.S. tax-sensitive Intel (INTC).

5149,investing,thri54,"There's something funky going on in the Uranium market. On the 17th of August, Uranium prices started climbing, and they've been climbing every day since.  Interestingly, nothing of note around nuclear power has come out since then.  Just rising Uranium prices and analyst upgrades for mining companies.  Feel free to correct me if you know otherwise.

For some background, there's been a perpetual shortage of Uranium production in the world. The total stockpile of uranium has been falling for over a decade straight.  

Coincidentally, the [Sprott Physical Uranium trust launched an at the market equity program on the 17th](https://sprott.com/investor-relations/press-releases/sprott-physical-uranium-trust-launches-at-the-market-equity-program/).  When premiums to NAV get too high, they sell more shares, which they are then obligated to spend any raised capital on acquiring uranium.   

I think that there shelf program is, literally, moving the market.  Uranium is a relatively small and illiquid market.  [Total annual uranium production is in the neighborhood of 130MM pounds.](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/uranium-production-figures.aspx)  Consumption is about 25% higher than that.  Sprott [lists](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/) their uranium stockpile on a daily basis.  As of Thursday the 2nd, they had 21.8MM pounds of Uranium.  Checking the Wayback machine, they had 19.8MM on Wednesday the 25th.  That's an increase of 2 Million pounds in 8 days, or 250,000 lbs per day.  Daily global production is only ~375,000 lbs.  **Sprott's trust has bought 67% of global uranium production over the last week**.  Volumes are accelerating, and it's possible their buying rate will increase going forward.  

I think we could be witnessing the beginnings of a  reflexive process here.  Higher uranium prices will attract more speculators, pouring more capital into the speculative acquisition of uranium needed by utilities, further driving up prices.  

TLDR:  The Sprott Uranium Trust has bought 75% worth of the world's Uranium production over the last week, and judging by the volume, it's accelerating.

When it comes down to sizing the global online gambling market, “all bets are on.” Grand View Research says it will grow 11.5% to $127.3 billion in 2020-2027, while The Business Research Company predicts an increase of 10.4% to $92.8 million in 2019-2023. With these estimates, gambling stocks –including those of online casinos– are roaring up.

## Online Gambling Growth

It was a tough last couple of years for brick-and-mortar casinos. The American Gaming Association reports that all commercial and tribal casino properties in the U.S. closed during Covid lockdowns, with tiers 1 and 6 operating between 24% and 50% capacity upon returning to operations. 

However, with this reactivation and the technological advances of online betting, the gambling industry is back with a bang and has become one of the fastest-growing businesses on the planet.

According to Insider Monkey, the online gambling market has reached 1.6 billion people, reigniting an industry that has seen a dramatic transformation through new technology. 

Play Today says that at least 80% of Americans gambled in the past year, as users rushed to online casino directories like Canada Casinos to crash the website, looking for some blazing betting fun.

During the pandemic, the business not only grew in size but also witnessed some eye-catching movements in online gambling stocks, with companies like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) soaring after its 2020 IPO.

Also, “MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) launched its mobile betting app BetMGM in partnership with Roar Digital, LLC,” Insider Monkey Reports.

## Stocks On The Rise

This year, 12 states in the U.S. will legalize sports betting spreading the impact to online gambling platforms. With this outlook, the famous site Gambling.com going public under the “GAMB” ticker, with a price per share estimate of 8$ –although down from $11 to $13.

The company controls more than 30 websites in 13 countries, and hit nearly $28 million in revenue in 2020 and $11.5 million in the first quarter this year.

Another attractive stock option within the online gambling market is Penn National Gaming Inc (NASDAQ: PENN), which was mentioned in the second quarter investor letter of Baron Funds.

The letter said: “Following a 232% gain in 2020, the shares of Penn National Gaming, Inc. declined 29% in the most recent quarter and are down 13% year-to-date. At its recent price of only $73 (down from a peak price of $136 in March), we believe Penn’s shares are now attractively valued.”

The casino firm is based in Pennsylvania boasting an $11.1 billion market capitalization. “PENN delivered a -17.98% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 32.73%. The stock closed at $70.84 per share on August 13, 2021.”

## Brick-And-Mortar

Amid the economic comeback, brick-and-mortar casinos are also on the way up. According to Truist analyst Barry Jonas gave Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) a Hold rating “and increased its price target from $43 to $38.”

The vaccine rollout is likely to exert a positive effect on these stocks, coupled with the company’s solid earnings and optimistic forecast.

Insider Monkey reports that “In the first quarter of 2021, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) had an EPS of $0.68, short on estimates of $0.85. The company’s net revenue decreased 15.6% or $1.20 billion from the previous quarter.”

As for Caesars Entertainment Inc (NASDAQ:CZR), the casino leader saw a solid EPS of $2.03 in the first quarter, up from $1.80. Its revenue during the same period hit $1.7 billion, an increase of 259.2% versus the last year. “Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) has gained 131% in the past 12 months and 27% year to date.”

I recently found some shares in a company that belonged to my late grandfather- literally a piece of paper, like how they used to do it in the old days. I'd hate to throw away something valuable on the assumption that they're worthless without checking.

I searched the company name and didn't see anything immediately. They might've gone bust, but **(hopefully)** they were acquired or merged and are still redeemable?

5185,investing,PmMeClassicMemes,"These accounts vary in restrictions depending on jurisdiction, but essentially the main commonalities are limited ability to position short (long puts only), and no direct access to margin. 

Off the top of my head :

1) Buying deep ITM calls (eg buy a SPY 250 call, it costs approx half of SPY and returns the same dollar change but a larger percentage)

Downsides : often high cost of leverage (like 5% premium to asset value), limited time horizon - if you bought march 2020 spy 250 calls for leverage a year prior you may have lost it all, while stock holders did not see any expiry

2) Buying levered instruments (3x daily etfs)

downsides : volatility drag, liable to blow up in a 2008 style crisis, expense ratio

3) Buying mutual funds or other funds that use leverage on your behalf (eg PSLDX) 

downsides : expense ratio, limited transparency for some, often illiquid and difficult to enter or exit on short time scales

4) Borrowing money (eg line of credit, refinance mortgage) to contribute to your tax advantaged account 

downsides : you can lose more than just your investments(bank can come for your assets), might be screwey with contribution limits to tax advantaged accounts

Are there any other methods i'm missing?  Thoughts on what the best way is? I feel like it's likely deep ITM options.

The stocks I’m going to present you below are generally believed to outperform the stock market in the coming months, they have a consensus recommendation of Buy, their fundamentals are scored considerably better than most stocks and their average target price by stock analysts is above current market valuation.

In order to consider buying the stock’s shares, the following criteria need to be satisfied:

* **TheStreet score**: A+, A or A-
* **Zacks Rank**: 1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold)
* **Weiss Ratings recommendation**: A or B
* **Yahoo Finance recommendation**: at least mixed Buy/Hold
* **Yahoo Finance target price**: min. 5% higher than current price
* **Piotroski F-Score**: min. 4
* **InvestorsObserver Overall Score**: min. 50  

**Note**: Descriptions of those criteria are provided at the end of this post as well as [HERE](https://www.investing-scientist.com/research/top-stocks-to-buy-a-consensus-strategy/). If you decide to buy any of the below stocks, you might want to consider the following selling conditions (at least one of them should be satisfied):

* price is higher or close to target
* profit is in range 20% – 30%
* loss is higher than 50%
* TheStreet recommendation is changed to Sell

#### Now, a few words on the criteria I’m using and sources of data.

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *– The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication — not a guarantee — we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):

*TheStreet Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we’re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500’s +10.6% .*

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*“A” Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a “****Strong Buy****“.*

*“B” rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a “****Buy****“.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. Piotroski F-Score**

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company’s financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from https://www.gurufocus.com.

**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

HC Approval. In the short term, it’s all that matters effectively. This company has many opportunities not discussed here, so the long term view is quite bright. In other words, the face mask and PPE market opportunity is a launch pad for the even larger opportunities that will come later. Thus, if HC approval does not come through-

(more questions that delay things beyond, let’s say a month or 2, or worse, an outright rejection – neither of which is expected, but can't be known with regulators until it becomes public, which is why getting approval is a MAJOR de-risking event for the company)

\-then expect the stock to have a rough time of it. On the other hand, if they get approval... This company is in what Stan Druckenmiller has described as “Inning 1.” If for some reason, HC does not grant approval and bless it as anti-viral and biocidal, but leaves the door open, then the stock steps back and it will be Stan’s Inning 0, as long as HC ultimately grants approval.

**Investment Thesis:**

***ZEN Graphene Solutions Ltd.*** **(OTCPK:ZENYF) (ZEN.V)** has a major catalyst ahead of it with the decision of Health Canada as to the safety and efficacy of its game-changing biocidal, anti-viral and anti-microbial AgGO-2 mask coating.

Risks are in favor of approval, which would be a major de-risking event, causing a rapid and significant (roughly 100%+) re-rating of the stock. For those less inclined to await approval, the intermediate and longer term upside would remain significant, even from those levels, giving a pre-approval *risky* investment or a significantly less risky post-approval investment.

The business model is extraordinary (discussed below), so if the company executes anywhere near plan, this will be a hyper-growth company that will be a ""must own"" over the next few years as the Graphene industry develops.

**An IP Play on an Innovative Nano-Material, Not a Mining Company:**

ZEN was a mining company. It is now an IP nano materials play (“graphene-enhanced” technology). The company recently announced it is asking shareholders to approve a change to their industry status with the stock market and that it will seek to move to a bigger exchange, hopefully in the US. The company has a graphite deposit which is at the development stage, which costs very little to maintain for now and which won’t be mined for many years, if ever. I expect de minimis expenses for the deposit for the foreseeable future.

**Three Initial Target Markets:**

*Prevention, Detection and Treatment*

1. Personal Protective Equipment (""PPE,"" e.g., masks, gowns, caps, booties, nitrile gloves (hospitals and restaurants, etc.) and Air Filtration (e.g., HVAC filters),
2. Detection/Sensors (e.g., game-changing rapid, inexpensive and high accuracy COVID testing, with other tests behind that, such as STDs (a huge and rapidly growing problem), certain types of cancer and other diseases/viruses) and
3. Therapeutics - both topical and ingested, but that's longer term in nature due to regulatory hurdles and could be tremendous, but let’s leave that for another time. In addition, there are many other potential applications, such as fuel additives to improve efficiency, paints to reduce ice on plane wings, and countless other applications.

**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**

ZEN’s first market will be the application of its formula to surgical and other masks. The effect of their formula is innovative and game-changing: it is to be applied on an additional layer of mask, which essentially grabs the particle (the formula is hydrophilic) when it hits the mask (either coming at the wearer or from the wearer) and then render it harmless.

The next PPE application will be for nitrile gloves. Given the tremendous threat posed by MERSA, alone, it seems logical that the company’s customers ultimately also will apply ZEN’s formula to surgical caps, gowns and booties.

**Air Filtration, Air Conditioning Filters:**

This is an enormous market, with various industry reports reporting it in the many billions of dollars. That’s when things are “normal” (i.e., pre-COVID). If the mask market is a company-maker, the A/C filtration market is a barn burner. There are millions of office buildings in the US and Canada.

There are over 6,000 hospitals.

There are over 21,000 nursing homes and elder care facilities.

There are airports, airplanes, trains, subways, restaurants, theaters, malls - all are high traffic, often densely packed and require the best quality filters on the market.

And all are desperate for solutions to create a safe environment to bring back business.

**Detection and Sensors:**

The company’s product (separate from the AgO-2 solution) provides next generation rapid, saliva-based antigen detection. In about 8 minutes and at very low cost per test, according to the company, the product uses a patent-pending DNA aptamer that recognizes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein simply through a saliva test.

Imagine going to an indoor concert today with 1000s of other people packed in in close proximity and no masks? What if for something like a $10 ticket surcharge, you could arrive at a pre-assigned time (let's say an extra 10-30 min early, depending on the size of the venue and number of entrances), get tested, have a highly accurate answer in 8 min, and then go in to the concert, free of concerns that the 100s of people anywhere near you and the 1000s in the auditorium have COVID.

Please see the company’s presentation for more details: [ZEN Graphene Solutions](https://www.zengraphene.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021_08ZEN-Investor-Presentation.pdf). The solution appears to be scalable, accurate (making PCR tests look awful) and has the added benefit that aptamers can be adapted to be used for many diseases, well beyond COVID. It's a tremendous market opportunity for the company that cracks this nut and also a very high margin business.

**Therapeutics:**

Down the road, the company is looking to enter the therapeutics market, including both topical and ingested applications. Management believes this market opportunity may be even larger than the aforementioned markets. As these take time to enter and will not drive revenue in the near-term, but also won’t cost much to pursue in the short term, I’ll address them at a later time.

**The Model:**

The company has initiated a pilot line and is producing roughly 1 million masks per day (1M mpd). The company is also building out a 25M mpd facility nearby their offices that is scheduled to begin ramping production in Nov. The same coating should be applied to many different use cases, so the company thinks about sales in “masks equivalent” (“me”). For instance, if a typical industrial air filter is 3m x 3m (my slightly educated guess), that would require roughly 100me.

**Margins:**

Assuming GM north of 80%, given that graphite (the underlying commodity) is cheap and plentiful, we’re talking about a nano-material, so very small quantities are required relative to output and revenue.

**OP's Note:** They are currently purchasing Graphene-oxide from a third-party to fullfill production, but anticipate a scaling-up of in-house production over the next year. Price of purchase is proprietary according to Exec. Dir. but claim that their studies of the material they are purchasing fit the bill for the mask-coatings.

**Expenses:**

Expect the company to be running at about $300K per month in opex, which already allows for running the new facility since most of it is automated machinery. Per [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiNxl9nMuZ4) Aug. 11th, opex was $200K/month, but given what the Chairman recently said on a public [investor](https://zoom.us/rec/play/o0pa1AWvr7JeqA8NB9eYv-msGZT6lyORYdfPNtQv0WsGV_xBAQeWx9kktlZAAW3_atTsk3TGZEAB3q1J.f6gqjOS0h0D6ZxTw?continueMode=true&amp;tk=BC-G9Hc3b6WfHM3UmFy3BtwyvR54zN_0CLWXDs2uJ94.DQMAAAAWnR6e9RZvMncxdTZNNVJwbVBlNDBFNUlkV1Z3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&amp;uuid=WN_Mt_sG54lRg2JoK-vzA8ctA&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=LzQDuI2dSS2ES6R-FeKTXQ.1629297669865.7b102740d4e41e5d6637da3088f7c22a&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=39) call, they’re hiring at least a few heads.

For the sake of conservatism, assume that given the massive ramp in revenue and profitability, they’ll end up spending more than that, so double their current opex number to $400K.

**Capex:**

Assume capex will be around $5M-ish, a good bit of which already has been spent. Regardless, the number is so low as to be inconsequential if the company is generating the kind of cash flow, it will, given their current cash position of something just over $4M plus a bit more than that amount in warrants, many of which are in the money and some of which have acceleration clauses; roughly $8M-ish+, all in, vs a very low burn rate.

Obviously, since they’re only beginning to ramp and generate revenue, there is a wide range of profit possibilities. Based on what co has said: Assuming the company makes something toward 4c/mask, based on what would be a conservative assumption, which is using the lower end of the midpoint of the revenue per mask the company mentions in its presentation, which you can review, as noted, above.

Let’s say that at some point in 1H:2022 they’re selling out the 25M mpd. That’s:

25M mpd equivalent x .04 = $1M/day in revenue

x 80%+ GM = $800K/day GP (all numbers in Canadian Dollars)

x 30 days/mo = $24M/mo GP -$400K/mo opex (using low end of what management has said)

= $23.6M EBITDA per month x 12 months = $283.2M EBITDA / year -27% tax rate = $206.7M in Net Income /99M shares (fully diluted) = C$2.09 annualized run rate EPS (approx. $1.66 in USD)

(the company has a $30M NOL that will reduce this on first earnings)

**Balance Sheet:**

With $4M in cash and more than that in in-the-money warrants, some of which have accelerator clauses, the Company doesn’t need capital. Assuming they get HC approval, are generating meaningful rev and cash flow and want to improve the company’s public profile, I could definitely see this Street-savvy management team raising capital opportunistically.

I’m okay with that: a company that doesn’t need to raise money won’t be forced to do so at unattractive prices, like so many small cap companies. A company growing rapidly with their business accelerating and a long runway will have investors clamoring to get in at scale, so deal terms should be very attractive for all parties involved. Since they don’t need money, they can be opportunistic about whether and at what price they might consider a deal.

If they continue to hit milestones, any such deal would only be done at multiples of the current price. (Yes, I know that sounds like every other small cap dream, but if you dig into this one, you’ll see it’s quite rational.) Anticipate that the company will seek uplisting on the US markets later this year if Sep 27th shareholder vote passes through.

**Misc:**

Lock-up expiration behind us: There was a deal in the spring. The lock up expiration is now well behind us (early Aug).

**Insider Buying:**

The CEO recently bought 50,000 shares (over $100,000) in the open market. He's already the largest shareholder, owning about 4% of the company. I see this as a vote of confidence in ZEN's prospects of winning HC approval.

**Summary:**

* ZEN is an IP play with a strong management team and an outstanding business model and is creating game-changing “must have” products, rather than “nice to have” ones.
* ZEN makes an innovative, proprietary, patent pending silver graphene oxide (AgGO-2) formulation at the nano-scale that will be applied to various materials for many applications.
* Revenues should start very soon, incremental margins should be very attractive and the company should be profitable and CF+ imminently, *possibly* earning their market cap within a year.
* If things play out according to base case, the stock should trade at a minimum of C$40+ within 12-24 months, returning well over 10x.
* ZEN potentially has a very long and steep growth trajectory that could last a very long time. This is the best idea I've seen in years.","Zen Graphene with 'Paradigm Changing Applications' in Healthcare, Green Energy, and Materials Science",1630603091

Companies that have generated high ESG scores  (when analyzed right) have proven to outperform other companies in their sector **over the long term.**

Again, over the long term.  


ESG analysis is thorough and when done right is not surface level.    
Therefore, these companies high in ESG Scores have statistically proven to outperform competitors in the long term. Therefore,  the financial incentive is that a high ESG score is associated with decreasing cost of capital.   


So we have ESG Funds popping up, and Asset management firms are hiring ESG Analysts - Governing bodies and other public entities as well etc. etc.

5223,investing,thekidsells,"Pretty self explanatory. You may not believe things will go down, and if so it’s not my intention to argue — I’m familiar enough with investing to know value stocks will win if held in the long run and I understand we’re in the greatest bill run in history BUT I can’t help but see breaks in the dam. I’m looking to make money when things go down. 

Mostly concerned with:

1. Exorbitant P/E ratios fueled by aggressive buybacks — inflates stock price without adding any tangible assets to companies 
2. Powell had no room to lower rates, we’re at the bottom, when we go up it will massively affect business lending and many low-margin businesses won’t be able to stay around without massive price increases 
3. Inflation isn’t transitory. Now that money velocity is returning to pre-pandemic levels we are seeing inflation everywhere. It’s not just cars. Unless there’s more lockdowns you restrict spending, you can calculate CPI anyway you want and it will continue to climb 
4. The reverse repo market is super sketchy and more banks are participating

You may not agree with any of this and believe the bull market will continue forever, but I believe we’re back in the pickle faced by Carter and will need to boost interest rates to combat inflation at which point a great majority of small companies will fold — and largely inflated P/E ratios will fall resulting in a catastrophic loss of market cap on Wall Street.

If you think this is possible, or heck even if you don’t, humor me and let me know how you’d invest. I’ve got some shares of FAZ, SPXU, and UVIX because they seem to have blown up when interest rates racheted up in fall of 18 and I expect a similar performance when the fed realizes it can’t print its way out of the PE bubble it’s created.

Updated coverage: Did 22nd Century (XXII) Made a Good Choice Bringing the Hop Plant into Its Family of Plants to Modify

Will the FDA Give Traction to Their VLN Cigarettes Soon?

Good day everyone,

We are continuing coverage on 22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII), a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.

Current price $3.3/share (at 10:00 AM EDT)

After closing at $3.57/share in the Tuesday session, XXII shares began looking for a level of support in early trading today. I believe a support level at $3.30/share will bring buyers in and we will see increasing volume and price throughout the day.

Remember, tobacco is still the flagship product at XXII and generates their revenues. For the FDA, the decisions on Juul and other manufacturers could represent a milestone as it tries to execute an ambitious tobacco regulation agenda. The FDA in April said it was taking steps to ban menthol cigarettes. And it continues to work on a potential requirement that nicotine levels in cigarettes be set at minimally addictive levels, a possible game-changer that the White House would need to approve. It’s possible XXII may see a mandate and approval announced together.

The hop plant market is not as highly regulated as tobacco or hemp/cannabis, providing a faster path to commercialization. If you have followed XXII you know they have been waiting a while for the FDA to approve their ability to advertise their VLN cigarettes as a safer alternative to standard tobacco. We all know that cannabis remains classified as a schedule one drug by the US government.

Hop and hemp/cannabis plants have many similarities. Both are part of the Cannabaceae family of alkaloid flowering plants and the active ingredients found in both plants offer potential health benefits for managing anxiety, inducing calm, addressing sleeping disorders and resolving stomach problems, among other wellness applications.

The fact that hop, and cannabis plants are similar is important because XXII has already done a lot of R&amp;D, including that done by its cannabis partner companies, that may apply to hop plants creating new proprietary plants. Let’s remember that XXII has valuable plant modification IP and know-how including utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other technology they have developed in tobacco and cannabis.

The hop plant has been grown and used to make beer for centuries (possibly millennia) without modification. XXII has picked a plant to be the third leg in in its plant modification tripod that is ready to be improved and expanded.

original report below

TL,DR - 22nd Century (XXII) Announces the Completion of Its Trifecta of Market Sectors with Tobacco, Cannabis, and Now Hops

Massive IP portfolio on the Tobacco and Cannabis Plants. **Now hops also?** I would say they have all major areas covered. (I will dive more into that later) no pun intended.

Good day everyone,

Coverage on **22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII),** a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.

Current price $3.57/share (at market close Aug. 31, 2021)

On August 16, 2021, XXII moved to the NASDAQ Exchange from the NYSE-American. The company participated in the closing bell ceremony on the same day. The company believes the move will increase their visibility and exposure to investors.

When I look at [the company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=XXII), I see how XXII has come off recent dips this year. On April 26th, the shares peaked at $6.07, then dipped to $3.56 on May 13th. On July 1st the shares had climbed back to $4.63 before consolidating to today’s level. XXII shares have now crossed their 200 DMA of $3.34 and are **approaching their 50 DMA of $3.67/share in a bullish manner**.

I often note insider holdings as a value metric because the insiders have a vested interest in the company’s success. Insider ownership isn’t very high (under 3%) at XXII, but the institutional ownership (all data per YF) is at 36.4% of the outstanding shares. **Some of the big guns are holding XXII shares like Blackrock (5.99%) and Vanguard (4.68%). ETF Managers Group is holding 7.38% of the company’s shares.** Hedge funds prefer the companies they invest in to perform sooner rather than later.

When we last covered XXII in July, we talked about the company’s trifecta of core products, tobacco, cannabis, and an unknown third leg. I spent some time trying to figure out what that third product was going to be. Since XXII was already in the tobacco and cannabis sectors I thought the new market would be psilocybin. Boy was I wrong. While psilocybin is an exciting and developing market, it is still relatively small and in it’s infancy. XXII doesn’t chase small markets.

In a [letter to shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/22nd-century-group-enters-global-132000137.html) published Monday, August 30th, CEO James Mish said “I am proud to announce our third plant-based franchise – the global **specialty hops market**. Like our existing franchises, the hop plant market is ripe for disruption and offers opportunities for 22nd Century to provide unique and significant competitive advantages to commercial partners. The addition of hops, a critical input for the $500 billion global brewing industry as well as a growing source of medically-important molecules, expands our total addressable markets to an estimated $1.3 trillion.”

95% of all hops are used to make beer. The rising demand for microbrew and craft beers is driving the specialty hops market where distinctive flavors, aromas and nutritional uses are important in creating unique and differentiated products. The XXII R&amp;D program objectives include creating new proprietary hop plants and valuable IP using their know-how and technologies, utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other non-GMO technology.

XXII is establishing a new subsidiary in the Netherlands, 22nd Century Group Europe B.V., to open new revenue opportunities in hops, as well as serve their tobacco and hemp/cannabis plant franchises through an expanded global footprint.

XXII is on the move now with a move toward globalization and a new product pipeline that may generate revenues quickly. The demand for proprietary, specialized, non-GMO hops is high and XXII has the tools to provide them.

7/23/2021 Cowen Initiated Coverage Outperform $5.00

**On the tobacco front**, earlier in August, the company announced that they were highly confident their MRTP (modified risk tobacco products) application has completed the FDA’s scientific review process and is now in the documentation process, the final stage before the FDA announces its decision. While the company’s VLN cigarettes were approved for sale in 2019, this important designation will allow 22nd Century to communicate key features of VLN® King and VLN® Menthol King, including the headline claim of “95% less nicotine.” VLN® tastes, smells, and smokes like a conventional cigarette. Both the FDA and the Biden administration have been looking for ways to curb illness, and consequently healthcare expenses, associated with cigarette smoking.

**On the cannabis front**, XXII has been building its network of partnerships to maximize the upstream segment of the cannabinoid value chain since 2019. Components of 22nd Century’s proprietary value chain include: plant profiling tailored to the needs of customers (CannaMetrix), genetics to deliver differentiated traits to maximize yield of a specific cannabinoid or deliver a certain taste or fragrance profile (KeyGene), and commercial-scale plant breeding and cultivation of disruptive plant lines as well as year-round ingredient extraction/purification (Extractas Bioscience, Sawatch Agriculture, Folium Botanical, Aurora Cannabis, Needle Rock Farms, and Panacea).

The XXII “trifecta” of market sectors it participates in is now complete with tobacco, cannabis, and hops. As CEO Mish pointed out above, these three sectors address an **estimated market of $1.3T**. Sometimes we get lost with those numbers but each **1% of a $1.3T market potential is $13B**.

The section titled ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below contains a description of the non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables below.

Financial Outlook:

Okta's financial outlook for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2022 includes the expected contribution from the acquisition of Auth0, net of purchase accounting adjustments. The acquisition closed on May 3, 2021.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company expects:

Total revenue of $325 million to $327 million, representing a growth rate of 50% year-over-year;

Non-GAAP operating loss of $35 million to $34 million; and

Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.25 to $0.24, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 153 million.

For the full year fiscal 2022, the Company now expects:

Total revenue of $1.243 billion to $1.250 billion, representing a growth rate of 49% to 50% year-over-year;

Non-GAAP operating loss of $119 million to $114 million; and

Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.77 to $0.74, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 147 million.

These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.

Okta has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items are out of Okta’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not available without unreasonable effort.

Conference Call Information:

Okta will host a live video webcast at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on September 1, 2021 to discuss the results and outlook. The news release with the financial results will be accessible from the Company’s website at investor.okta.com prior to the conference call. The live video webcast of the conference call will be accessible from the Okta investor relations website at investor.okta.com.

Supplemental Financial and Other Information:

Supplemental financial and other information can be accessed through the Company’s investor relations website at investor.okta.com.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

This press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, free cash flow, free cash flow margin, current calculated billings and calculated billings. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, non-cash charitable contributions, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and integration-related expenses, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs and loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt.

Okta believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by the Company's management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.

Okta encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.",Okta Announces Strong Second Quarter Results,1630527595

First things first, if we want our money to stretch we have to think outside the box 
 Although I do believe in this company, I would like to help Microvast gain traction in the EV battery industry. In order for me to do that I need to make sure we’re all on the same page. Microvast does make me wet, but not wet enough. You know what would make me wet enough ? If we could dispose of the people spreading false information/ their worthless opinions. It is affecting the community as a whole and it’s rusting our tracks. 
THE INTRODUCTORY SOLUTION  
First we need to somehow contact Jimmy Neutron, I’ve been studying his work for years and he is extremely knowledgeable. Some of his in inventions include ‘but are not limited to’ 
Gravitrax SK30,
Burp powered jet pack ,
Spoofinator 3000,
ION Ray,
And my personal favorite, Laser Sword

SOLUTION
Long story short, contact Mr.Neutron about the mass manufacturing of thicker electrodes (that preform well) with aqueous processing. As this will ultimately lower battery cost. A lower cost of battery’s will help enable widespread adoption of our company, which will lead to higher earnings, which will then lead to our stock increasing in value, which will lead to more money in our pockets.

5383,investing,3STmotivation,"Since I started posting on uranium last year, a lot has happened in the sector and we have seen equities increase multiples across the board. There have been plenty of catalysts that have spurred on this move, including reactor life extensions, COVID mine disruptions, new reactor buildouts, capital flows, shut down of supply and several more. A new catalyst has entered this market in recent weeks however and has had an immediate positive effect on the sector. This catalyst was Sprott taking over uranium participation corporation and converting it into the Sprott uranium trust. After everything was said and done, they implemented their USD $300 million ATM and went to work putting in a front curve bid for physical uranium (an oversimplification to be fair, but I want to keep this post short and to the point as to not stray too far off of the main point).

And putting in a bid they did, surprising perhaps even the most bullish expectations, as they went on to add approximately 2,7 million pounds of uranium in just 2 weeks and they are showing no signs of stopping at this point. To give you all some context, that 2,7 million pounds is roughly equivalent to the annual fuel needs of 6 standard 1GW reactors. There was already a firm supply/demand gap in place that formed that basis for this uranium bull thesis and Sprott will widen this gap even further in the months ahead. This will likely accelerate if they can acquire a NYSE listing in Q1 or Q2 of next year, opening the door to additional capital that wants to participate in this bull market via a liquid and well managed vehicle, causing the purchasing of additional pounds in the process.

This trust is an absolute game changer for the sector, as it provides the market with something it has not really seen in this magnitude before, with a consistent bidder in the uranium spot market that can really ramp up the price of physical uranium. Equities will follow this rise and there is no saying what this trust could achieve for the sector once it gets fully up and going. There is also still plenty of time for it to achieve that ramp up, as the price of uranium still needs to rise by roughly another 80% at least to incentivize enough new production for some form of breakeven across the market. However, that break even appears to not be enough to fix the current and upcoming supply/demand gap and an overshoot in price is looking more likely by the day given prevailing circumstances.

There are a lot of moving parts to this vehicle and I have been working hard to put the puzzle together and this post is merely a short summarized version of that work, but I can firmly say that this is the catalyst that has the potential to supercharge what was already a very compelling investment case. I will be watching the developments closely and the coming 2-4 years have never looked as bullish for this sector in my opinion. Should you have any questions regarding this development or uranium in general, please let me know below or via a message and I will be glad to help out. Thank you for reading, please always make sure to do your own due diligence as well and I hope you all have a good and healthy rest of your day.",The biggest catalyst in recent history is showing results for the uranium sector,1630587324

&gt;“The group has risks of defaults on borrowings and cases of litigation outside of its normal course of business,” Evergrande said, adding that it would pursue further asset sales, control costs and seek to attract new investors.  The warning comes as Evergrande experiences the worst upheaval in its history, with a stream of recent problems raising questions over its access to financing, forcing it to sell assets and earning it an unusual public rebuke from the government over its debt risks.... 

I'm sharing this because ***if*** this were to default, it could be a trigger for some much larger market turmoil. Evergrande represents potential systemic risk both in China as well as the global financial markets. IE, this defaulting ***could*** be a bit of a Lehman-esque type moment.

With that out of the way, I want to be very clear - **this is NOT likely to default** since the strong likelihood is that it will get a bailout due to the system wide risk attached to it for China. 

With that being said, history has a lot of examples of policy mistakes, or attempts to control asset bubbles that simply end up popping the bubble. I stated this a few months ago, but the current attempt from Chinese policymakers to control debt and reduce economic risk is a tightrope walk, and there are legitimate risks of overtightening. With that said, China has a LOT of control over all the levers in their financial system, so if any country would be able to stop a cascade, it's likely China.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Note:** Please at least try to refrain from making this into an ideological or political debate about China.  Given, sometimes these things merge into the financial realm of discussion, but at least try to take a neutral view of this.",Heavily indebted Chinese developer Evergrande warns of default risk,1630590878

I’m 34, have 3 kids, wife doesn’t work, and I am fortunate enough to own a rental property with no mortgage.  I net about $1250/month after HOA, taxes, insurance etc. that doesn’t include unexpected expenses like fixing the AC or dishwasher etc. 

Currently, I really like the cash flow from the rental because it helps cover our own expenses like day care and mortgage on our house. 

But I’m wondering if it might be smarter to just sell the rental and put everything into SPY or something and hope to see it grow. 

If I were to sell the rental today I could probably get about $275k, and then subtract 6% realtor fees and also 20% of 50k in capital gains (bought for 225k about 4 years ago). So lets say I come out of it with 250k (if I did the math right). Would I be better off taking the 250k and putting into the market to let it cook for 20 years, occasionally pulling from it when I need it or is it better to keep the rental, invest some the income and then watch the equity on the house grow over time?

I would love to hear if anyone has similar experiences or is good at running a comparison model.

As far as I'm concerned, 100% of the values of crypto currencies is speculation (as opposed to intrinsic value) and price changes just depend on social sentiment, so are crypto price targets just ""intuition,"" or is there anything more to it?

Conversely, when analysts calculate a price target for a stock, they have several tools at their disposal: there are relative valuation methods, dividend discount models, free cash flow models, residual income models, etc. And sure, each of those tools do require some guessing and assumptions, but analysts are tasked with doing enough business research that they can make the best educated guess they can under a certain confidence interval. And that's not to say that every analyst does their job well or honestly, but good analysts do try to make confident price target calls using the tools mentioned above.

* Valuation
* Profitability
* Growth
* Health

The scores are calculated using the indicators shown in colored boxes  above. For instance, to assess stocks profitability, Return on Assets (**ROA**), Return on Equity (**ROE**) and **Net Margin**  are taken into account. The algorithm looks up the value of ROA in  every stock belonging to the same industry and compares it against the  analyzed stock, providing a final rank: if there are 20 stocks and 5 of  them have higher ROA, then the ROA-associated score is (20-5)/20 \* 100 =  75, meaning that the ROA is better than in 75% of stocks. We want ROA  to be higher than in the other companies; sometimes, however, we want to  be lower than in peers, as is the case with Price to Book ratio (**P/B**).  Then, the mean score across ROA, ROE and Net Margin is calculated.  Similar with Valuation, Growth and Health scores. The algorithm starts  with Valuation score, requiring it is at least 50/100. Then it proceeds  with Profitability, Growts and Healts scores, each time requiring the  score to be 50 or higher. Finally, for the remaining stocks the mean  value across all four areas of interest are calculated. Only highest  ranking stocks are the ones of interest and subjected to further manual  inspection.

As far as I'm concerned, 100% of the values of crypto currencies is speculation (as opposed to intrinsic value) and price changes just depend on social sentiment, so are crypto price targets just ""intuition,"" or is there anything more to it?

Conversely, when analysts calculate a price target for a stock, they have several tools at their disposal: there are relative valuation methods, dividend discount models, free cash flow models, residual income models, etc. And sure, each of those tools do require some guessing and assumptions, but analysts are tasked with doing enough business research that they can make the best educated guess they can under a certain confidence interval. And that's not to say that every analyst does their job well or honestly, but good analysts do try to make confident price target calls using the tools mentioned above. Is there anything like that for crypto? And if so, what?

**Disclaimer:** **I'm simply condensing some thoughts I've had on payment for order flow (PFOF). I'm just a casual observer, and this is the internet. For all you know everything I'm about to say is complete BS.**

Payment for order flow =/= front running (which is already illegal). Nothing I have seen or experienced leads me to believe that PFOF screws over retail investors in any meaningful way.

Might you get better fills if you use a brokerage that doesn't participate in PFOF? Sure. Does it matter? No, at least not for the vast majority of retail investors. If you're in that *tiny* (probably non-existent) minority where your bottleneck to greater profits is fill quality, then you probably wouldn't consider yourself an investor, and probably aren't reading this post.

Think about it: If you bought AAPL a month ago, does it really matter that your order *technically* might not have filled at the best possible price? What if you only DCA into SPY? If you were gambling in penny stocks or options having no idea what you were doing, is PFOF the deciding factor of your P/L? No. Isn't it great that we can do all of these things without worrying about paying commissions? I think so.

Even if you *could* get better price improvement from a broker not participating in PFOF, you're still never going to do worse than the [NBBO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp).

It used to not be very clear to me *why* market makers are willing to pay so much for retail order flow. Then I read [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/hnkiaz/why_is_this_subreddit_so_popular/fxbzcx3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/hnkiaz/why_is_this_subreddit_so_popular/fxcfrlc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from someone who implies they are a market maker, and the light bulb went on. Here are the highlights:

&gt;...  
we literally buy up your order flow and make pretty good money off of it because you guys genuinely have no clue what you're doing  
...  
in aggregate your orders are effectively random noise that we can trade against to make a small spread  
...  
If I'm market making, I'm putting a bid at price B, and an ask at price B + S for some S &gt; 0. I am hoping that someone will sell to me at price B and buy from me at price B + S, so that my profit on such a pair of transactions will be S, the spread.  
...  
So anyways one guy, Joe, has his fancy indicator X signal to buy stock XYZ and shortly thereafter another gal, Jane has her fancy indicator Y signal to sell stock XYZ. The ad-hoc nature of many of these ""indicators"" is that most of them will not be correlated with one another and in aggregate will mostly average out to some fraction of S.  
...  
So if I know that there's a group of unsophisticated traders on stock XYZ, I want to trade against them in aggregate compared to trading against a sophisticated trader who may actually know what they're doing.  
...  
The remaining risk in the above strategy is that XYZ can have actual legitimate signals such as news that causes the price to swing heavily in one direction or another, so usually when market making you find a basket of stocks that are delta neutral.

This makes the most sense out of anything I've ever read about PFOF.

If I'm a market maker and it's *literally my job* to be transacting in the market *all day every day*, and my goal is to make money from the bid/ask spread, I don't want to be exposed to any other source of P/L. The best I can hope for is to take opposing trades to as many orders as possible whose P/L will average out to 0. I'll make the spread times however many round trip trades that I've taken.

Now let's look at front running.

Here's what FINRA says about front running ([rule 5270](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/5270)):

&gt;No member or person associated with a member shall cause to be executed an order to buy or sell a security or a related financial instrument when such member or person associated with a member causing such order to be executed has material, non-public market information concerning an imminent block transaction in that security, a related financial instrument or a security underlying the related financial instrument prior to the time information concerning the block transaction has been made publicly available or has otherwise become stale or obsolete.

English translation ([source](https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/f4-433/mccann1.htm#:~:text=Front%2Drunning%20occurs%20when%20portfolio,same%20securities%20for%20their%20clients)):

&gt;Front-running occurs when portfolio managers buy securities in their personal accounts prior to buying the same securities for their clients, or when the managers sell securities out of their personal accounts prior to selling the same securities for their clients.

If I want to make money by front running, I want to see a lot of large, one-sided orders, and get in on *the same side* as those orders before they're executed (remember a market maker will always take the *opposite* side). When they go through, and the market moves to that side, I'll make money.

It seems like a bad idea to try and front run retail flow, given its smaller average order size and uncorrelated nature. Retail flow probably won't be moving markets in most cases.

Obviously the GME/meme stock situation might be different, but maybe not. Here is an interesting point that was made in [a thread](https://www.nuclearphynance.com/Show%20Post.aspx?PostIDKey=200252&amp;PageIndex=2) on NuclearPhynance:

&gt;I can't speak for GME, but in similar conditions, you'd really be surprised just how non-toxic the order flow turns out to be. Especially on a short-term basis. A lot of the real flow winds up being near random and totally insensitive to the spread, unaware of its own impact, and uncorrelated with microstructure alpha. Obviously, that's all great for market makers.

5649,investing,AnmarAaluse,"Hi Crypto Enthusiasts,

Today I'll be sharing my journey in aiming to create one of the worst tokens (memecoin) ever deployed, from the very start. This could be a beneficial adventure for those seeking to start a new project, or those looking to invest in cryptocurrencies, hope you enjoy it!

Just in the end of July, after ""memecoins"" and crypto in general is forming a buzz word for a while especially after some making huge profits, a team was chosen to make something different. As a head start, memecoins are cryptocurrencies that have might not have utilities but grow based on their visions and targets, proven to be massively profitable in vast case studies. Having said that, the team want to address an issue or solve a problem, carrying a mentality that if we want to put any effort in this, it must have a life-changing impact!

So the initial step is to look at how to write the smart contract, which was obvious at that point to be mainly forked and standard by vast of the existing legit memecoin projects. Such projects rely on the what so called ""tokenomics"" to attract investors, which is in essence a percentage payable as tax, which is then redistributed according to how much an investor is holding. For instance, the buyer will buy 100 coins, then get only 90, where the 10 will be redistributed to all the holders, which will be repaid to the buyer in the same manner. So, We noticed that this tokenomics is actually profitable to the devs, the marketing wallet, and the very top holders only. So we decided to make the taxes zero; getting out from the memecoin concept aren't we? - Well, we kept pushing forward.

So it was decided, no fees will result in no redistribution, so what's next? the most important aspect, which is the vision of the whole project. So what issue will we be addressing? How can we make the maximum impact within a market where trust is becoming an issue perhaps threatening its existence?

We had an idea to track vast crypto articles and groups to identify the most repetitive word, guess what was that? yes, Fear - Doubt - Uncertainty aka F. U. D.

So what would we do with this word? we continued to monitor and note the activities of tens of memecoin groups until we noticed that the use of the word is mainly accompanied by a ban. And this was the weirdest point ever. So if an investor is doubting, he/she will be banned. If an investor is crossing the boundaries by asking where is his/her money, they get banned. Weirdest thing we ever saw, and couldn't understand. I mean, isn't an investor the same as a customer contributing to the success of the project? isn't the investor rightful to ask for progress even if it hurts developer/owner/admin feelings?

From there the idea was born; with a bit of research, it was noticed that criticism could mainly be constructive, and by constructive we can link ""care"". In other words, those who care are being silenced and banned which could be negatively impacting crypto adoption.

From this ideology we adopted the concept that says: fudding isn't bad, it is actually good! and this was the starting point, deploying an honorable idea token, with zero tax, we named it the FUDcoin Official. We created the Telegram group, pages, etc. So what is next? the marketing.

How can we market a coin that represent negativity, and make it so easy for everyone to understand what we stand for? and there it was, so obvious, negative marketing. So the marketing strategy being adopted (for the first time ever in Crypto), is that this is the worst project ever (perhaps this could make it the best). And here we go, we have the ethos, the vision, the roadmap, the token, and the strategy, and guess what? it was huge! everyone liked it. Negative marketing is hereby tested for the first time in the same market the rely heavily on positivism.  

Finally, we needed to set a launching date. What would the best possible launching date be to represent fear, negativity, doubt, and uncertainty? We googled the worst day and saw that in every year, if the 13th day of a calendar month hits a Friday, this could be the worst, representing bad luck. Opening our calendar guess what, Aug 13th, a Friday, in few days! Isn't that a sign? We believe it was.

For here folks this is part one of two parts, stay tuned to the post launch story, the results, and the angry marketing girl.

Hope you liked it and tell us what do you think!","My experience in creating the worst crypto coin ever - Turning Crypto Investments, to a vision.",1630278258

5691,investing,JonDyna965,"A lot of mining sites of a chunk mining companies are located in various parts of the world. Mining activities can affect the environment and the communities in these mining sites, so I think mining companies should also prioritize projects that will promote responsible mining and inclusion of the local communities.

For instance, Newmont Corporation (NEM) has sustainability programs that involve environmental and social responsibility. The company has environmental standards that are designed to protect the environment and prevent or otherwise minimize, mitigate and remediate the impacts of their mining activities in the mining sites’ locations. They also involve the local communities, providing jobs and provisioning local goods and services, which makes them become an important player in catalyzing the economic development and social well-being of host governments and communities. They also have the [Global Center for Indigenous Community Relations](https://www.newmont.com/IndigenousCommunityRelations/default.aspx), whose role is to “to advocate for excellence in engagement with Indigenous Peoples, both within Newmont and across the industry.”

With junior companies, Solaris Resources ([SLS](https://www.google.com/search?q=TSE:+SLS&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10_UNDbPiiyvjK03SeBaxcoQEu1opBPsEAwAqUS8YSAAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiMuov1vNHyAhXbAogKHZriDHMQsRUwIHoECDYQAw&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=609)) has remarkable projects focusing on these matters. The company is very inclusive when it comes to the local miners in the community, and hired a lot of them, generating jobs for people. They also put a priority on using locally sourced products and services whenever practical, to benefit the regional economy. Also, the company has an environmental management project with the goal of minimizing the impact of mining on the environment. This is also more possible since the current president of Ecuador vowed to emphasize the enforcement of environmental protection rules and larger involvement from indigenous communities in deciding the future of mining projects.

Somehow, a lot of corporations feel less responsible for the damage they cause to the environment and to communities with their projects, so I think it should be the responsibility of these companies to change and be more inclusive and responsible. All these globalization and the current climate of economic rationalism is making these people less human and deprived of compassion and sense of responsibility.",Mining companies and engaging with communities and environmental advocacies,1630326196
5692,investing,natery5,"Here it is, I got lucky.  I took a few loans in different ways to daytrade:

- $20k
- $10k
- $6k from my girlfriend
- $4k from credit cards
- some savings from my regular job

The reason I took so many loans is that I was constantly making little money and losing. At one point, I decided to put together as much money as possible and went all in on GameStop after the first squeeze.

When GameStop hit $340 the second time, I sold it all literally 5 minutes before it dipped, and made $65k.

Since that moment, I've been trading with $50k+ and it's been really easy to make money, so I decided to quit my job. After quitting, I got my hand into $25k that they had to pay me as severance.

Bottom line: I extinguished my $10k loan, and I'm constantly re-financing my credit cards with credit card money (so no loss there). My girlfriend doesn't want her money back, so that's good.

My problem is, I'm still $27k in debt with the bank, and right now I'm trading with $65k. I figured that, considering taxes, I have to make $1500 monthly to break even. If I pay off the bank, that amount is reduced to $700.

However, if I pay off the bank, my trading power will be reduced to $35k, which is insufficient, in my experience, to make money just trading stocks. So what do I do? Keep trading until those $65k become, lets say, $100k, and then pay off the bank? Or just extinguish debt and go back to trade with under $50k?

Chinese regulators on Monday slashed the amount of time players under the age of 18 can spend on online games to an hour of gameplay on Fridays, weekends and holidays, in response to growing concern over gaming addiction, state media reported.

The rules, published by the National Press and Publication Administration, said users under the age of 18 would be able to play games only from 8pm to 9pm local time on those days, according to the Xinhua news agency.

Online gaming companies would be barred from providing gaming services to minors in any form outside those hours and would need to ensure they had put real name verification systems in place, said the regulator, which oversees the country’s video games market.

Previously, China limited the total length of time minors could access online games to three hours on holiday or 1.5 hours on other days.

The new rules come amid a broad crackdown by Beijing on China’s tech giants, such as Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, which has unnerved investors, hammering Chinese shares traded at home and abroad.

The National Press and Publication Administration also told Xinhua it would increase the frequency and intensity of inspections for online gaming companies to ensure they were putting in place time limits and anti-addiction systems.","More crackdown by the CCP on video games, minors can only play 1 hr on Fridays, weekends and holidays.

Looking at his company's fundamentals, there are some very attractive features financially, but the declining businesses owned by Biglari were my first red flag. Biglari started by buying Shake Shack, and now owns five businesses that in my opinion are all not great. He currently owned over 60 percent of Biglari holdings via his own personal shell company, Biglari capital corp, which coincidentally owns 50 million in Berkshire Hathaway. 

He holds annual meetings similar to how Berkshire does, but according to past attendees, the meetings usually involve shareholders berating him for ridiculously high compensation.   Unlike Buffett, Biglari did not start by being an investor, but instead sold a company he owned at the peak of the internet bubble. He also lives lavishly, with a huge house, expensive suits, and a wife who looks like a gold digger of gold diggers. What really made me look at him as a Buffett wannabe was the company website.

&gt;  
&gt;The e-commerce giant is partnering with [Affirm](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AFRM) for its first-ever installment payments option on the popular e-commerce site.  
&gt;  
&gt;Affirm’s buy now, pay later checkout option will be available to certain Amazon customers in the U.S. starting Friday with a broader rollout in the coming months, the companies said in a statement. The partnership will let Amazon customers split purchases of $50 or more into smaller, monthly installments.  
&gt;  
&gt;Affirm’s stock spiked as much as 48% after-hours Friday on the news, adding more than $8 billion to its market capitalization, later settling up around 33%. Amazon shares were unchanged.  
&gt;  
&gt;Friday’s partnership is the latest sign of the booming lending space as younger consumers move towards these alternative lines of credit. Earlier in August, Square jumped into the space with a $29 billion [deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/02/square-to-buy-australia-fintech-afterpay-amid-buy-now-pay-later-trend.html) to buy Australian fintech Afterpay.

&gt;So-called installment loans have been around for decades, and were historically used for big-ticket purchases such as furniture. Online payment players and fintechs have been [competing ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/10/pay-later-is-booming-with-a-wave-of-companies-launching-installments.html)to launch their own version of “pay later” products for online items in the low hundreds of dollars.  
&gt;  
&gt;Affirm is one of the best known installment payment options. It works with more than 12,000 merchants, including [Peloton](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PTON) and [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT).

&gt;  
&gt;Affirm said some of the Amazon customer loans will bear interest, but some will come with 0% APR.  
&gt;  
&gt;“By partnering with Amazon we’re bringing the transparency, predictability and affordability that Affirm provides today to the millions of people who shop on Amazon.com in the U.S.,” Eric Morse, Senior Vice President of Sales at Affirm, said in a statement. “Offering Affirm’s alternative to credit cards also delivers more of the payment choice and flexibility consumers on Amazon want.”

5908,investing,cbus20122,"For the people out there who follow the macro environment, there is always a lot of discussion in past market bursts (such as 2008 or 2000) that there are or were fed policy mistakes that either caused or contributed to the meltdown.

This is relevant now because as we come into talks about tapering, there is a lot of chatter about a potential fed policy mistake one way or another. 

But I think this is a poor way to think about these items, and views of mistakes completely ignore the context of the macro environment and ***why*** the fed made the supposed mistakes in the first place. 

**Most Policy Mistakes Are Fed Decisions Where They're Forced To Choose Between Two Bad Choices**

# Fed Policy Quick History: Caught Between Tough Choices

Lets start with a quick history of important fed decisions, many which have been labeled policy errors in the past. 

* **1980-1982 Volcker Rate Shock:** This was the worst recession the USA had since the GFC, and capped off an era where Inflation was the boogeyman and there were multiple bad recessions and employment shocks. At this time, inflation was running extremely hot (over 10%), and it was starting to get out of control. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Raising interest rates would kill the economy, which was already having a tough time dealing with the inflation of the time. Rates would have to rise to 18%, which would seriously cut off lending growth. But it would effectively stem the tide of inflation. Volcker chose the very tough decision to raise rates to 18%, which effectively cut inflation down significantly.   
Another point worth making is that the introduction of Reagonomics was a key factor in reversing the age of inflation of the 1970's, where there was a significant lack of investment in new productive capacity.  At the time, this was extremely beneficial. OF course, we're more or less at the opposite end of that spectrum right now where we have a glut of overinvestment and have possibly taken the 80's policies too far (obviously subject to political debate and views).  
* **1998 LTCM Bailout:** This was a historic bailout that occurred during a time of a lot of international market turmoil (Asian financial crisis + Russian default) and a burgeoning US equity bubble (dotcom bubble was starting to really pick up steam here).  The sudden failure of LTCM however threatened systemic issues in the financial system, and thus became the first bailout of a private hedge fund by the FED. This was a new precedent, and many believe it kickstarted the parabolic phase of the dotcom bubble. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Do you allow the LTCM meltdown to spill into the rest of the US banking system and economy, or do you bail out LTCM and support the economy + job growth? The fed chose the latter, which at the time supported their mandate of stable prices and full employment. They did not have a crystal ball suggesting an even greater equity bubble would form from this. 
* **2000-2003 Dotcom Bubble Burst:** After likely contributing to the dotcom bubble with the LTCM bailout and interest rate decrease, inflation started to rise a bit in late 1999, and credit growth and equity mania forced the Fed's hand to cap the bubble before it became even more difficult to control. The fed did a few emergency rate hikes, and the credit cycle quickly turned down, which had been feeding the dotcom mania. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Critics of the fed would have said that the emergency rate hike burst the bubble. Critics of the fed also said that they let the bubble get out of hand. Literally, there was no good choice here except to bite the bullet and hope the landing wasn't too hard. In reality, the *real* economy did have a soft landing in the dotcom bubble, partially thanks to the fed's interest rate decrease after the bubble really started to get going. 
* **2007-2008 GFC:** After dropping interest rates to keep the economy afloat during the GFC, very few people wanted anything to do with equities, especially tech stocks. This caused a shift in behavior towards real estate, which was already quite strong and resilient even during the dotcom crash. At the same time, the global economy was recovering from the crises of the late 90's and dotcom era, the euro was being adopted as a currency, and China was rising as a member of the world trade organization. All of the above created a perfect storm for US real estate getting piled into via carry trades, while the US Dollar was getting depreciated by all the above factors. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** The fed clearly started to see the monster that was being created in 2005. Not only was credit growth going parabolic + real estate lending going off the charts, but inflation was also surging in the USA due to all the aforementioned factors. Gas prices surged to over 4$ per gallon (at a time when many drove ""clunkers""), Copper surged to very high prices, and real estate / rent was also going parabolic. Greenspan was looking into a surge in inflation that hadn't been seen since the 70's, and was forced to decide between allowing real estate and inflation to go completely unchecked, or to raise rates very quickly to stem the flows from getting more and more out of hand.   
He chose the latter of raising rates, which then led to the chain reaction causing the GFC. Thing is, we don't know how much worse things may have gotten if Greenspan chose to ***not*** raise rates. Think of how much larger the US real estate bubble would have become if it wasn't cut off at the source. As bad as things got in 2008, they could have been worse if they allowed things to continue. 
* **Post GFC Environment:** After the GFC, the Fed shifted stance and most central banks became far more accomodative. The reaction of policymakers to any asset drawdowns has become far quicker and far larger. With that said, there have been some scares where the fed was tightening a little bit, which threatened to choke off the economy. The most noteworthy one was in late 2018, where the rate hikes and QE Rollback caused a 20% drop in markets before the fed reversed policy to engineer the 2019 rebound. This was likely a close call in some regards.   


# Lessons and Takeaways

From all the above, there are a few important lessons for investors when it comes to understanding equity and credit cycles + risk in the macro economy.   


1. **The party likely will or can continue so long as the central bank / government are accomodative:** You'll notice that all of the above recessions occurred during a time when the central banks were ***forced*** to tighten financial conditions.   

2. **Inflation (asset inflation or economic inflation) is always what takes the punch bowl away:** So what causes the fed or government to reverse accommodative policy? Almost always inflation. With a mandate to maintain stable prices and employment, inflation in the real economy tends to damage consumer's wallet and destabilizes prices. Inflation in assets typically comes with credit expansion, and threatens to destabilize employment and prices as it becomes larger and increasingly more fragile. These items generally tie the central banks' hands and force them into tough decisions. The ***levels*** at which the fed is forced to take away the punch bowl however is a lot more subject to opinion, and definitely not precise however.   

3. **Raising rates or tightening policy into an overleveraged environment creates systemic risk:** If you note the difference between the 1980's rate increase from Volcker, and the interest rate increases from the GFC or even in 2018, you'll notice how much more sensitive the economy is to rising rates. And furthermore, you'll likely realize how much more convex the downside gets with the more debt that exists in a system.   

4. **Debt in a system puts a soft cap on long term inflation rates:** Because central banks tend to get forced into action when inflation rears its head, and because the central bank behavior causes debt defaults and credit issues to arise, this forms something of a natural soft ceiling on how high both inflation as well as interest rates will go before triggering a deflationary shock. Once again, this isn't any set level, but you get a good broad view of this by looking at long term interest rates since the 80's, and then looking at aggregate leverage / credit.   

5. **The fed shifting to less accomodative stances isn't consistent with timing of market selloffs or recessions:** If you're trying to time the market based off this alone, you may get it right some times, but other times you would be far off. This timed the top of the dotcom bubble, but also missed out on the top of the GFC by over two years and quite a few rate hikes. It also missed out on most of the gains in 2017 and 2018 despite rising rates.   

6. **The fed doesn't make ""mistakes"", they make choices to deal with the problem at hand over the problems that may occur in the future:** In nearly every situation, the fed's dilemma caused them to choose between dealing with the problem that is currently occurring in the market with the risk that their solution could cause a problem somewhere else down the road. In every instance, the fed chooses to deal with the ***current*** problem over the problem that may be. And most people would not do anything different, because we don't have crystal balls and can't predict the future. I do think the fed has made bad choices, but most of the choices actually fit their **mandate**. In other words, don't hate the player, hate the game.","Some Thoughts on Fed Policy and ""Policy Mistakes"" As We Start Talking About Tapering",1629996638

A case can be made in favor of a large productivity increase from work @ home + by polling data workers enjoy it more (obviously).

All of this makes me believe Salesforce will receive a vastly quicker return on investment on Slack than the market assumes. On top of this, Salesforce is combining their other cloud tools (including Tableau, leading data analytics tool) into Slack.

Salesforce is trading at a lower valuation gap compared to it's competition, despite being better positioned in the wider long-term economy due to Slack.

Salesforce has unrecognized blue-chip potential over the long term, and is building an undervalued economic moat by building a cloud platform on top of Slack to leverage into the ""new normal"" of work-from-home.

5917,investing,zero_to_one_,"**#1 Progress and profits come from monopolies, not competition**

Capitalism is about accumulating wealth. But in a world of perfect competition, nobody actually makes any money; all economic profits are competed away. Competition should be avoided wherever possible. Rather it is worthwhile to think about how to run away from the fighting and build a monopoly business instead.

**#2 A company messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed**

It’s pretty much impossible to fix a bad company culture when you already have thousands of employees. Make sure you’re investing in a company that has had the right culture since day one.

**#3 Founders are built different**

Most traits are probably normally distributed. Most people are average. Founders are not. Founders’ traits seem to have an inverse normal distribution to them. Founders are at the extremes on both ends: they are extreme insiders and extreme outsiders, disagreeable and charismatic, infamous and famous.

**#4 Great companies have “secrets”**

Risk aversion and complacency discourage people from thinking about secrets. Existing conventions are much more comfortable. But secret truths can be incredibly valuable. The question of how many secrets exist in our world is roughly equivalent to how many startups people should start. From a business perspective, then, there are many great companies that are waiting to be started.

**#5 The last mover advantage**

You’ve probably heard about “first mover advantage”: if you’re the first entrant into a market, you can capture significant market share while competitors scramble to get started. That can work, but moving first is a tactic, not a goal. What really matters is generating cash flows in the future, so being the first mover doesn’t matter nearly as much as being the last mover!

**#6 Be a contrarian, but also right**

There is usually little value to be found where there is unanimity. Value tends to be hidden. The key question is: What important truth do very few people agree with you on? The business version of this is: What valuable company is nobody building? A certain degree of contrarianism is embedded in these questions. Wrestling with them can lead to important truths.

Powell is expected to make press on economic policy this Friday 08/27/21 
The much anticipated Jackson Hole symposium kicks off on Thursday, where central bankers will potentially provide updates on their plan around tapering monetary stimulus. The Federal Reserve has been purchasing at least $120 billion of bonds per month to curb longer-term interest rates and jumpstart economic growth as the pandemic wreaked havoc on the economy.

I've heard the saying that when economists say there will be a correction, it is the time to buy. And when the Government (the Fed) says the economy is in a good space, it is time to sell. 
This is just all from anecdotal and media. I might be wrong. 

Taper talk is the worry, but if inflation continues to run hot and economic data continues to be mixed the timing of tapering could get pushed,” noted Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. “It’s unlikely that the Fed will force a taper on an economy that isn’t ready, and the outlook is becoming less certain with the rise of the Delta variant.”

Bell added that the deciding factor could be August’s jobs report due Sept. 3, given that Covid cases have jumped in the past month as the delta variant spreads.

Several tech companies will report earnings on Wednesday after the market closes, including Dow component Salesforce. Box and Snowflake are also on deck.

&gt;The Nvidia and AMD machine, to be called Polaris, will not be a replacement for the Intel-based Aurora machine slated for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago, which was poised to be the nation's fastest computer when announced in 2019.

&gt;Instead, Polaris, which will come online this year, will be a test machine for Argonne to start readying its software for the Intel machine, the people familiar with the matter said.

6090,investing,sixth-edition-value,"West Fraser timber is a Canadian lumber company that produces and processes wood products. They are traded on the TSX and the NYSE, and they are based in central British Columbia. They are the largest logging company in the world by market cap (11.71B) and by production capacity (6735 MMfbm). Canfor is a very close competitor with a capacity of 6700 MMfbm. 
Canfor has a very similar story. They are based in Vancouver, and despite their high production and production capacity, they are valued at more than ⅓ of WFG.
	The industry is closely tied to economic conditions, and lumber has recently been at record prices. Since then, lumber prices have come down to close to the decade average. The economic concerns here are not very important, but it will be important to consider that the high lumber prices may have artificially boosted operating results. 

A comparison of the two lumber companies (Dollar figures are all in CAD):

|Metric|WFG|Canfor|
:--|:--|:--|
|Market Cap|11.71B|3.34B|
|Revenue|5.850B|5.454B|
|Net Income|776M|559M|
|Lumber production (MMfbm)|5958|5204|
|Debt/Equity|0.2|0.25|
|ROE|24.6%|21%|
|Current Ratio|2.5|2.1|
|Total assets|5.32B|5.108B|
|Total Equity|3.155B|2.664B|



Comparatively, it is quite confusing why Canfor is worth so little. WFG has slightly more sales, net income, production, and balance sheet size. But does an eight percent difference in figures really warrant WFG to be worth almost four times as much as Canfor? They have slightly more efficient operations, and their balance sheet is slightly healthier, but when looking at some of the price ratios such as P/E and P/B, Canfor suddenly becomes more favorable. 
	Canfors’ balance sheet has grown significantly since 2014 from 2.48B to 5.1B, giving us a CAGR of 11%, which is partially attributable to an excessively favorable economic environment. WFGs balance sheet CAGR over the same period is 8%. Sales follow a similar trend. It is more clear now that the lesser's financial position is at the expense of greater growth. 	Constructing a conservative DCF may also provide some more insight. Here are the results I got from my calculations:
	
|Company|Price Range, 10Y DCF|Margin of safety|
:--|:--|:--|
|Canfor @21|$100-$120|79-82%|
|WFG @76|$200-$250|62-69%|



As you can see, the valuations are pretty crazy. I have not seen businesses that can generate cash like this in a long time. Both of them look incredibly attractive on this metric.
	
As an investment thesis, I would have to choose Canfor. They are so similar operationally and in numbers, yet their price is ridiculously low even for a conservative valuation.",Canfor versus West Fraser Timber,1629947560

This comes after the [industry’s top gold producers](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/top-five-gold-mining-companies-world/) – Newmont, Barrick, AngloGold, Polyus, Kinross, Gold Fields, Newcrest and Agnico-Eagle – felt the effects of a 6.5% reduction in output to 24.98 million ounces in 2020, following lower ore grades, sale of assets, lower mill throughput and lower recoveries.

But data and analytics firm GlobalData [projects](https://www.globaldata.com/gold-production-top-eight-companies-expected-increase-3-1-2021-says-globaldata/) production from those companies to recover and reach somewhere between 25-25.75 million ounces in 2021.

The most significant falls in production last year were observed amongst the top three companies – Newmont (6.1%), Barrick (12.9%) and AngloGold (7.1%). The collective output from those miners declined to 13.7 million ounces in 2020 from 15 million ounces in 2019.

Vinneth Bajaj, associate project manager at GlobalData, said: “After a strong first quarter in 2020, Newmont’s production was impacted by lower ore grades at the Ahafo, Yanacocha and Merian mines and the temporary suspension of the Cerro Negro, Yanacocha, Eleonore, Penasquito and Musselwhite mines between March and mid-May. In addition, the sale of Red Lake and Kalgoorlie projects further reduced output.”

Lockdowns imposed by governments impacted gold production last year

For Barrick, several gold mines were forced to cease operations temporarily due to the government lockdowns imposed to stem the spread of coronavirus infections, including the Veladero, Pueblo Viejo and Porgera sites.

Meanwhile, the divestment of African assets by AngloGold was a major factor behind the fall in the company’s output in 2020.

OPEN recently reported a great Q2, beating estimates with revenue of $1.2B and a net loss of $143M. Q3 projected revenue from the company is $1.8-1.9B and unless I’m not understanding something correctly, I think they are about to post a $3B+ quarter in Q3.

Background: I used to spend 20-30 minutes a day looking through OPEN’s website and calculating the number of homes listed/sold. Was lucky to stumble upon ibuyerstats.com and I’ve found it to be fully reliable, saving me lots of time and it has some helpful analysis. 

Calculation: according to ibuyerstats.com, OPEN has listed 4,989 homes since July 1st. The total number of homes listed on OPEN (only homes that are OPEN owned, not just homes people list themselves) has increased by 503 since July 1st. So a simple calculation tells you that OPEN has sold ~ 4,500 homes so far this quarter. At an average selling price of $400k, OPEN has pulled in revenues of $1.8B in just 53 days (already what they were projecting for the whole quarter).

53 days is 58% of the days in a quarter, and when you add in the other 42% you get revenues of $3.1B, however this doesn’t include revenues from homes listed earlier than the start of Q3, their listing platform, and a general increase in sales that is likely to continue through the remainder of Q3. 

I’m completely open to any criticism as I’m genuinely curious if any of you think this simple calculation is a fair representation of the quarter OPEN is about to deliver.

*Hi guys, so for all my life I've been a conservative and fundamentalist investor ( sadly it has not yielded me much of the gains I want ) and at my current age 20-30's i thought to myself if i won't take more riskier positions now as a young adult with no family depending on me. Then when should i take on more riskier portfolios and investment opportunities?*   


*Recently got into crypto and well boy let me tell you, Fundamental Analysis quickly goes out of the window here. It's unregulated, unenforceable, and most countries have no feasible legislation as to its implementation most especially with block chains and smart contracts ( it's basically the new technology which incorporated bitcoin's tech into having utility and purpose ). This is what sold me on crypto currency sometime last year actually when I saw first hand how a block chain network could actually provide utility now. As a fundamental investor on crypto I was sold. Now a decent chunk of my portfolio is in stocks and i'm looking to move it into crypto soon.*

  
To all fundamental analyst of securities and stocks in particular, I've personally been bothered by this for a long time. Why on good earth would a stock sell below its book value ? I mean I just don't get it. It should be no brainer that people should be buying out that stock because if that company closed down tomorrow you'd be getting your money's worth   


If a stock has a book value of let's say 10 usd per share and it's being traded on an exchange for 2 usd per share. Isn't this free 8 usd per share you're taking home ?

6190,investing,Market_Madness,"#**Introduction**
The world of finance is absolutely filled with people making claims about what’s good or bad, how you should or shouldn’t do something, and what you can and can’t achieve. My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I’ve found. I’m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. 

Every method of valuation has its pros and cons. For example, the price to earnings ratio can only be used on profitable companies and the price to book ratio is quite terrible with companies that are heavy on intangible assets. I’ve already done write ups on these two ratios for anyone new to these. 

So, none of them are perfect, but one of them can come quite close – with a little bit of help. I’m going to explain what price to sales is, why it works, how to use it, and then I’m going to make a modification to increase its effectiveness.

#**What is P/S?**
The price to sales ratio is calculated by dividing the company’s total market cap by it’s total revenue. Why it’s called price to sales and not price to revenue, who knows, but revenue is simply the number of sales times the number of units sold so the name isn’t too far off. 

What is this ratio actually saying? It’s a way of normalizing the relationship between the market cap and the revenue. Let’s say a company’s market cap is $100 and that their revenue was $25. Dividing 100 by 25 results in a price to sales of four. This means that this company earns 1/4th of its total value each year. This number on its own doesn’t really mean anything, but it’s a way to compare companies to each other. Let’s say we have a second business that has a market cap of $300 and a revenue of $100 which results in a price to sales of three. When market caps and revenues are in the billions it can be hard to tell which one makes proportionally more money. When you normalize them like this you can see that the second company makes 1/3rd of its value each year vs the 1/4th from the first example. 

Knowing this, it makes sense to buy companies with lower price to earnings ratios because a lower ratios means you’re making proportionally more money for your size.

#**Real application**
Most fundamental ratios are aimed at finding good value stocks that may be underpriced, however not everyone is looking for traditional value stocks. Price to sales is one of the few ways to value growth stocks as well as stocks that are not yet profitable. These types of companies often have low or negative earnings. This is likely because they are either just starting to grow, or because they are reinvesting everything back into the company to attempt to grow faster. If you were using price to earnings these would appear to have incredibly high or non-existent ratios and would be quickly ignored by most people. Price to sales still very much applies to value stocks, I simply wanted to show that it’s not exclusive to them like many other ratios are.

So now you know how to calculate it and that it can be used on almost anything, but how do you actually use it. If you’ve read my other write ups or watched any of my videos you’ll become very familiar with this answer – you use it to compare similar companies in similar industries. The reason for this is because you want to minimize external factors that could shift the results one way or another. Price to sales is often considered to be a judge of popularity because some sectors will have higher ratios simply because they are more popular industries. Innovative new companies working on artificial intelligence or green energy will likely have higher ratios than tobacco or oil companies even if their financial statistics and growth expectations were the same. This is simply because people *like* those companies more.

#**The good and the bad of using sales**
Let’s dive into the positives of using sales or revenue as a metric. The revenue a company earns is a pretty straightforward number. There are fewer precursory steps to reach it than something like earnings or book value, both of which can be manipulated by different business and accounting practices. This means that it’s generally more reliable than anything that is derived later down the line. As I mentioned before, it can be applied to a wider array of companies because basically every company has a revenue. It also does not get influenced by the ratio of tangible or intangible assets like book value can. This makes it sound far superior to both anything that uses earnings or book value, but it does have some pitfalls. 

I had two example companies above, one company worth $100 and earning $25 and one company worth $300 and earning $100. We determined that the second one, which has a P/S of three, was better. What if the first company only had $10 in expenditures while the second company had $75? The $100 company would take home $15 in profit and the $300 company would only take home $25 despite being three times larger. When you multiply P/S by the profit margin you arrive back at P/E. The lesson here is that revenue doesn’t mean as much when you don’t know the profit margins. If you don’t want to be tricked by this, either compare companies that have similar profit margins, or make sure both P/S and P/E agree on which company is better. 

The next pitfall on our list is the issue of cash and debt. A company with more debt has more leverage. They can spend additional money which allows them to generate additional returns. A company with no debt might have $10 to spend which might yield $20 in revenue. A company with x2 leverage has $20 to spend which might yield $40 in revenue. This boosts their revenue but it’s because they were taking on more risk, not because they actually performed better. Thankfully this also has a pretty nice fix. Let’s make up yet another hypothetical company. Company C has a market cap of $500, a revenue of $100, this would give it a P/S of 5. It also has $25 in cash, and $125 in debt. This company has a good chunk of debt which gives them some additional leverage. To make this more normalized we can convert their market cap, the P in our P/S equation, to EV which stands for enterprise value. EV is calculated by taking the market cap and adding the debt and then subtracting the cash. So, for Company C that comes out to be 500 + 125 – 25 = 600. You can now use this to get their EV/S, which is six. This is higher than the five they had before because we took away their leverage. Now all companies can be compared on a more even footing. 

#**Conclusion**
Price to sales, or as we will now call it, EV/S, is generally considered to be the most effective fundamental ratio out there. Now, just because it is the best doesn’t mean you should use it alone. You should always use fundamental ratios as only one of many available tools. 
Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, let’s see how it does stack up even on its own so that we can give it a fair comparison to other ratios and ideas. Buying stocks with a low P/S ratio outperformed broad market indices 95% of the time during any 10 year period from 1953-2003. During this same period the lowest P/S stocks outperformed the highest P/S stocks by a factor of over 1,000. The stocks with the lowest P/S ratios had an average return of 17.46% and the stocks with the highest had an average return of 3.12%. Whether this will continue to work in the future is, as always, not guaranteed.
If you want to make use of this tool for yourself, use EV/S and make sure you look at profit margins. Between these two points you’ll have accounted for the two pitfalls discussed. Use it on similar industries and use it as part of a set. Thank you for reading. 

#**TLDR**
Price to sales can be misleading on its own, but you can mostly fix this by accounting for differing levels of cash and debt as well as by checking profit margins. This new ratio, after the adjustment, is called EV/S and it is the most effective fundamental ratio, at least on its own. It can be used on value stocks, growth stocks, and even unprofitable companies. Use it, along with other tools, to compare similar companies to find which one is most likely underpriced.

&gt;  
&gt;**Samsung surpassed Nestle as the world’s biggest dividend payer, with Rio Tinto, Sberbank and Sanofi also making the top five.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The research, published Monday, said 84% of companies around the world either increased or maintained their dividends compared to the same quarter in 2020.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Dividends paid to investors are projected to hit $1.39 trillion in 2021, reflecting a recovery that’s stronger than expected, according to a new report from British asset manager Janus Henderson.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The 2021 forecast for dividends is just 3% below the pre-pandemic peak, the firm found.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Dividend payments in the second quarter jumped 26% from the same period last year to $471.7 billion, just 6.8% below the levels seen in the second quarter of 2019. Janus Henderson projected that dividend payouts will return to pre-pandemic highs within the next 12 months.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The research, published Monday, said 84% of companies around the world either increased or maintained their dividends compared to the same quarter in 2020.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Much of the growth was attributed to companies restarting frozen payouts and issuing higher special dividends on the back of strong earnings. Underlying dividend growth in the second quarter, stripping out the effects of special dividends and exchange rates, was 11.2%.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Samsung](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined) surpassed [Nestle](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NES.N-CH) as the world’s biggest dividend payer, with [Rio Tinto](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RIO-GB), [Sberbank](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FKRX300) and [Sanofi](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SAN-FR) also making the top five.  
&gt;  
&gt;Samsung distributed a total of $12.2 billion to investors once its regular dividend was included, and Janus Henderson anticipates that it will likely be among the world’s top five payers throughout 2021.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The rebound has been so much stronger than we anticipated, and I think it is very encouraging that we are seeing these companies feeling strong enough to return cash back to shareholders,” Jane Shoemake, client portfolio manager for global equity income at Janus Henderson, told CNBC on Monday.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Geographical divergence  
&gt;  
&gt;**Payouts in the U.K. surged 60.9%, and in Europe climbed 66.4%, while most of the dividend cuts were in emerging markets**, the report said, reflecting the delayed impact from lower reported 2020 profits. It said dividend cuts in developed markets were “pre-emptive and precautionary.”  
&gt;  
&gt;**North America, meanwhile, saw record dividends in the second quarter, driven by Canada. However, payouts in the region had largely held up through 2020, meaning there was little rebound effect.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In Asia-Pacific outside of Japan, headline dividend growth was 45% annually in the second quarter, buoyed by Samsung’s one-off special dividend, with South Korea and Australia leading growth in the region. However, Singapore remained constrained by restrictions on banking payouts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Japanese dividend payments also remained robust in 2020, but still managed underlying growth of 11.9% year-on-year.  
&gt;  
&gt;**In emerging markets, however, dividends fell 3.2% annually on an underlying basis, pulled down by lower 2020 profits, while just 56% of emerging market companies raised or held dividends steady in the second quarter.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Portfolio implications  
&gt;  
&gt;**Mining companies showed the fastest growth on the back of booming commodity prices, while industrials and consumer discretionary companies also bounced back strongly, the Janus Henderson research showed. So-called defensive sectors, such as telecoms, food and household products, maintained their characteristically consistent single-digit growth rates.**  
&gt;  
&gt;“In terms of the highest yielding sectors, the financial services and commodity sectors dividend outlooks are the most improved since last year,” said Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson.  
&gt;  
&gt;The firm has been adding to positions in these sectors in its equity allocations over the past 12 months in a bid to capitalize on this rebound. Many banks and financial services companies were subject to regulatory restrictions on dividend payments during the pandemic, which are now beginning to lift.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The travel and leisure sectors remain hardest hit in terms of the Covid impact, and while many have adjusted operations to be able to survive, the sector is unlikely to be paying dividends until balance sheets recover, so we continue to avoid these for the time being,” Lofthouse added.","Dividend payouts to hit $1.4 trillion in 2021, nearing pre-pandemic levels, research shows",1629734217

6265,investing,LifeReboot___,"Hey guys, so I'm pretty new to options (\~1year), and I started out mostly doing short term bets, but recently I've been thinking about using Leaps in my long term investment portfolio.

The idea is simple, but first of all this is my thesis of the strategy:

* The market always go up in long term because of technology advancement, and economic activities.
* Bear market can happen, but usually last at most 5 years. (Probably the riskiest assumption in the entire strategy.)
* Consistent yearly investment into Leaps, for example buy $100k worth of Leaps every year for decades, or gradually increase the yearly investing amount with 5%\~10%.
* Buy OTM+10% SPY Leaps with 3 years expiry, then sell them after 2 years with 1 years left to expiry. (Obviously this part will need more thinking, but the idea is to have a consistent strategy, it can be buying ITM/ATM/OTM, or buying 0.5Delta, or sell every 1 year instead of 2, which I will need to run some back test to find out the best possible option.)

What I think this strategy is that it could outperform the market performance by the leveraging the market performance it self, and maintain a long term consistent (or gradually growing) exposure of SPY.

Obviously another criteria here is not to lose money or turn out wasting time because of the theta decay, that is why I would also sell the call options with \~1year before expiry.

To verify the strategy, I purchased SPX historical data from [historicaloptiondata.com](https://historicaloptiondata.com) and [cboe.com](https://cboe.com), to ""backtest"" the idea of this, because lack of skills in writing custom back test strategy, I only able to backtest manually with one variable at a time.

Because of the hassle of backtesting the strategy, I can only do simple backtest such as buying 1 option per year etc, but what surprise me is the average return of this said strategy are able to outperform dollar cost averaging SPY in the period of 2005-2021 for at least twice of the ROI.

What I'm trying to do next is to find a way or have someone write some back test strategy with the data, so I can run the strategy with more different variable to see if the results of outperforming is consistent, which may take some time.

6355,investing,Market_Madness,"#**Introduction**
The world of finance is absolutely filled with people making claims about what’s good or bad, how you should or shouldn’t do something, and what you can and can’t achieve. My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I’ve found. I’m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. 

In this write up I’m going to be taking a deep dive into another incredibly popular metric – the price to book ratio. I’m going to start with a walkthrough of how you calculate it, then I’m going to cover how it should be used, then I’m going to go over some of the pros and cons of it, and most importantly I’m going to see if it gives you any kind of advantage when selecting stocks. 

#**What is P/B?**
A company’s price to book ratio is the ratio between the company’s current share price and their current book value per share. Book value is essentially the value of a company from the perspective of an accountant. Accountants don’t care about future earnings or potential speculation. They look at the current value of the business by taking all of the company’s assets and subtracting all of the company’s liabilities. This is then divided by the number of shares to get the book value per share. Once you have that you simply divide the share price by the book value per share to get the price to book ratio. 

#**Real Application**
Now I’m going to walk you through a real example. Total assets and total liabilities can be incredibly complex numbers to try and calculate, thankfully every public company will already have these numbers listed on their balance sheet which can be found on any number of websites. I grabbed Ford’s values from Yahoo Finance for this example. 

To find their book value you will be taking their total assets, which are things the company owns that have value and subtracting their total liabilities, which are things the company owes or is obligated to pay, like debt, interest payments, or workers’ wages. This is then divided by the number of shares in existence. This gives Ford a book value per share of 7.91. This means that for every $13.61 share - Ford has $7.91 of “real” value. Now the last step is to divide the price per share by this number which results in a price to book value of 1.72. 

Now before I can go into depth on how to interpret this number I need to explain the different ways to classify assets. Assets come in two forms, tangible, and intangible. This is important to know because it explains why some industries have significantly higher average price to book values than others. Tangible assets are most commonly physical things like factories, land, or machinery. However, they also include two less intuitive items which are cash and investment vehicles like stocks or bonds. The thing that all of these have in common is they have a relatively easy to find real monetary value outside of the company.

The other category of assets are called intangible assets which are things that are not physical and only have a theorized value. This can include copyrights, brands, or research. These have value but it’s far harder to put a price tag on them. In the standard price to book calculation the two will be added together if the intangible assets are given on the balance sheet. Another reason I defined both is because you will sometimes see people use price to tangible book value which means they did not consider intangible assets in their calculation. 

#**How to use P/B**
We calculated Ford’s price to book ratio as 1.72. Now like most fundamental ratios this seemingly random number each company has means absolutely nothing without some context. There is no definitive line of what defines a good or bad number because companies can have vastly different amounts of tangible vs intangible assets - and intangible assets are incredibly difficult to price. As with all fundamental ratios, you should only be using them as one of many data points to get an idea of how the business stacks up against similar competitors.

For example, a consulting firm with a handful of employees and one small office building could generate as much profit as the steel mill on the other side of town. But because the steel mill has a lot more physical assets it’s going to naturally have a much lower price to book ratio. These companies are effectively equal but if you use price to book blindly you won’t see them that way. This means that in order to get the most out of a price to book comparison you want companies that are within the same sector and often even within the same industry.

To illustrate this point, I calculated the average price to book ratio of all of the sectors over the past few years. The technology sector which relies heavily on intangible assets has an average price to book of 7.3 which is the highest. One interesting thing I found was that even among sectors that are very physical in nature the value varies by *a lot*. Industrials have an average of 4.8 whereas the energy sector has an average of only 1.65. 

But what do these numbers actually mean? The price to book value compares the current valuation of the company, which includes future growth and speculation, to their current value, according to the balance sheet. A price to book of 1.72 means that the stock price is valuing Ford at 72% more than what their current accounting value is. At the very least, this means that large investors have an idea of how much they’d lose if the company went bankrupt and needed to be liquidated. This tie to real value is one reason why value investors prefer low price to book ratios, although as we saw when looking at the sectors, low is relative. 

Let’s continue with the ford example and see how it can be used in practice. Let’s compare their 1.72 price to book value to tesla, who is the largest of all up and coming electric vehicle makers. Tesla has a price to book of 26.95 which shows that their price is almost entirely speculative and is incredibly disconnected from their current real value. For reference, the average price to book ratio for the automotive industry is about 4. You can see how Ford and Tesla stack up here. This doesn’t necessarily say that tesla isn’t something to buy, but it does say that it is a growth stock that people expect *a lot* from in the future. If tesla is not able to reach the levels of growth speculated it will appear to be a disappointment to its investors and has a lot farther that it can fall before it reaches a more stable price when compared to something like Ford. If Tesla fails miserably and goes bankrupt the shareholder is unlikely to get back more than a tiny fraction of their money. If ford fails miserably and goes bankrupt a large shareholder could potentially get more than half of their investment back – though the process of bankruptcy and liquidation is large and complex with varying results. 

#**What are the pros and cons of P/B?**
Price to book is a complex ratio that has a lot of implications. I’m going to go over a few of the benefits and shortcomings of it. Let’s start with the positives. 
* Price to book can be used on companies that have negative earnings. New companies that aren’t yet profitable are very common and without a positive net income can be difficult to compare to companies that are profitable. Many companies that aren’t profitable are still great businesses as long as they are heading in the right direction. 
* Price to book also offers investors a look into how much of the stocks price is based on real value and how much is based on speculation. This it is incredibly effective at separating growth from value stocks – so much so that the Russell indices use price to book for half of their decision weight when creating their value ETFs. 
Now let’s look at some of the potential downsides. 
* Price to book does not give any indication of how well a company is using its assets, only that it has them. If you have two companies that both have one million dollars’ worth of machinery and the same price to book ratio, you have no idea which one of those is actually making more money. This emphasizes the idea that you always need to look at a variety of  factors when trying to find good value companies. 
* Another downside is that it also struggles to incorporate intangible assets because they are often incredibly difficult to value. This makes comparisons between more physical and less physical companies nearly useless with this metric. 
* Lastly price to book value can vary from company to company because it relies on how that company does their accounting. This effect is even more pronounced if you try to compare companies from different countries. 

#**Does P/B give you any advantage?**
Now, can price to book value help you outperform the market by identifying undervalued stocks? It depends. The first thing it depends on is what type of company you are looking at. Price to book works far better on businesses that are physically intensive because the land, machinery, and factories all have significant real value. It also works well with banks and other financial institutions because cash, stocks, and bonds are all also considered tangible assets due to their easily identified real value. It does not work well when you are looking at intangible industries. Software companies, consulting firms, and pharmaceutical companies are all examples of highly intangible areas of business. 

So, if you are looking to compare tangible companies from a similar industry - price to book has historically been a fantastic predictor of value. The paper called “value vs glamor: a global phenomenon” goes into incredible depth regarding the performance of price to book value. From 1968 to 2008 the 10% companies with the lowest price to book value outperformed the highest 10% by an average of 9.3% annually. This is a massive amount and with this it is pretty clear why many index ETFs use price to book to build their value ETFs. 

However, it’s not all great news. The paper titled “price to book’s growing blind spot” which covers up until 2016, shows that the price to book ratio has been losing its edge in the last decade to the point where it has almost no benefit. This is a completely true phenomenon, but I want to explain why it may be misleading. 

The last 10 years have been a part of the strongest bull market in history and this market is being led by primarily technology stocks. If you recall, technology stocks are mostly intangible and therefore are not able to be judged accurately with this metric. It is up to you whether you think this trend will continue. If you do, price to book may not be a metric you want to use. However, if you are looking at the long term and expect the market to return to more historically average conditions then it is likely still an effective measure of finding value. 

#**Conclusion**
The price to book ratio has certainly earned its fame, at least historically. Aside from the past 15 years the price to book ratio has selected strong value stocks again and again. It’s up to you whether you want to bet for or against the current paradigm of the market which is dominated by intangible technology. This will determine whether or not you should make price to book one of your tools. 

###**TLDR:**
Historically P/B has been one of the best predictors of value. This trend has nearly completely disappeared in the past 10-20 years. This is likely due to the dominance of tech companies which are incredibly heavy on intangible assets. Ideally it should only be used as one of many data points when selecting a stock and should only be used to compare similar companies in similar industries. 

###**Mild subreddit self-promotion:**
If you enjoy these kinds of posts I created my own subreddit r/FinancialAnalysis where myself, and eventually others, will be doing this style of research.

Only time will tell.

This coming week Amarin's drug Vascepa will be prestented at ESC congess on Aug 29th with results showing it pay help treat COVID patients. If you can, I suggest to go watch the results that day.

Also last moment to trade shares once the COVID treatment results comeout will be on the Frankfurt exchange.

Recent article below by Amarin's CEO below. Put in bold what he said was important.

Then, in March 2020, U.S federal courts invalidated several patents for Vascepa, opening the door to generic competition and potentially shrinking sales of the company’s once-promising drug.

Amarin’s stock price fell by 50% virtually overnight.

The court rulings could have been a death sentence for a company like Amarin. Instead, it has rebounded with a risky, unusually aggressive strategy for a small drugmaker that markets and sells a single pill.

Karim Mikhail, Amarin’s CEO and a 22-year veteran of Merck, said the company will launch sales of Vascepa next month in the European Union and plans to expand into Asia and Africa next year. The company also has added sales staff to battle generic drugmakers for U.S. sales.

“People who fought for the value that this product brings to the market are not letting go today,” he said. “They risked their careers … to prove a point that this product brings enormous benefit.”

It plans to thread the needle to profitability with overseas sales and fighting off U.S. generic competitors by pushing doctors to prescribe Vascepa to more heart patients. Here in the U.S., it must do so by selling a drug that on average costs 77% more than generics.

J.P. Morgan analyst Jessica Fye still believes Vascepa will be successful, she said in investor notes, but sales will ramp up over 10 years.

This month, former Amarin CEO John Thero was succeeded by Mikhail, Merck’s former chief marketing officer in Europe and emerging markets. His appointment and the expansion of Amarin’s sales staff indicated the company plans to go it alone.

“Investors may be disappointed in the transition and that it may signal no near-term merger and acquisition on the table (which is the clear and primary bull case to the stock),” Jefferies analyst Michael Yee wrote in a recent investor note.

Big pharmaceutical companies typically buy up startups to avoid the risk and expense of drug development. But companies like Amarin are rarely acquisition targets, according to studies by Michael Kinch, director of the Center for Drug Discovery at Washington University in St. Louis.

Vascepa joins a long list of cardiovascular drugs over the past two decades dominated by blockbusters marketed by Pfizer, Merck, Schering-Plough and AstraZeneca.

The most commonly prescribed heart medicines are today available as low-cost generics. And generics typically capture 95% of the brand-name’s sales three months after generic drugs hits the market, according to Wall Street analysts.

The generic version of Vascepa, has not experienced that level of success.

Mikhail said Vascepa was notoriously difficult to manufacture and the raw ingredients difficult to acquire in bulk. “Clearly, the generics never thought they would win this case,” he said. “The evidence is they were not ready with supply.”

The FDA says Vascepa’s mechanism in action to reduce stroke and heart attacks is “not completely understood.” Amarin claims the drug has anti-inflammatory properties and it has announced several academic centers are studying Vascepa as a possible treatment for colorectal cancer as well as Covid.

Mikhail said preliminary Covid study data is scheduled for release next week at the European Society of Cardiology Congress.

**“You look at what Covid patients die from, they mostly die because of an inflammatory storm,” he said. “If the study is positive, and it has value in delaying progression in Covid patients … that would be incredible.”**

**It would also give Amarin another escape hatch to deliver shareholder value.**",$PFE buying $TRIL will $AMRN be next?,1629722600

6451,investing,alimessimourad,"Moving all noise aside and concentrating primarily on a business as if it was not even a public company is what counts (E.g Buying a bakery, hairdresser salon or anything else that produces cash). This will help you genuinely value a business without emotion. 

The most important aspect of a business is its ability as to how much cash it can generate on UNLEVERAGED net tangible assets. 

Alibaba's business is a lot more complicated compared to a simple hairdresser business but if you really only only concentrate on one business and analyse it thoroughly you will come to a ballpark figure.
 You wiol find that all internet based companies operate on hardly any Tangible assets which will allow them to generate piles of cash without plowing a tonne of cash into it every year. 

Alibaba is one of those businesses that can produce without the need of a shitload of Tangible asset re-investment. 
If you really look into their balance sheet and their returns you will see that alibaba is an extraordinary business running on very little UNTA (Unleveraged net tangible assets).
 
I can go on all day but we'll take a rough approach to last year's true earnings (without the EBITDA, or adding back Stock back compensation to earnings) they produced roughly $18 billion (adding back some amortization of intangible assets and the anti-monopoly fine paid but not adding depreciation of PP&amp;E because eventually you will need to reinvest that amount or close to it). In my opinion alibaba required app. $33 billion to operate which is give us about a 55% return on capital employed. An outstanding return for a company of this magnitude, remember this company is investing heavily is R&amp;D.

If you minus all liquid/net assets(which do account for something in the long run) you are virtually buying this company's for approximately $370B

Now we haven't even progressed to making a profit from CLOUD which is inevitable and very enticing because it has a healthy profit margin  (Look at AWS) and we haven't accounted for its $11 billion dollars of other income. 

They are building an ecosystem and they are investing in Loss-making operations which is questionable for me, are they allocating capital efficiently? Something I can not predict and is highly questionable.

6456,investing,FaintCommand,"I'm trying to understand the drastic drop they've seen and am curious if anyone else following this stock has some insights?

$EAR (Eargo Inc) is a hearing aid manufacturer that is ""disrupting"" the market by selling customizable hearing aids online. They aren't for extreme hearing loss, but seem to be a good solution for mid-to-mild hearing loss. Their calling card seems to be that their devices are almost invisible, comfortable, long charges (16+ hours, I believe), and the devices can be controlled from a smartphone or with 'gestures' that adapt to different settings. *I don't know anything about hearing aids, so I'm just going by what I've read from reviews and reddit.* 

They dropped quite a bit after Q1 earnings despite beating EPS estimates, then dropped again with a big EPS miss in Q2, despite 44% YoY growth in revenue. Subsequently, the price has dropped about 70% from their February high to $21.48 as of Friday's close.

Dropping after a big EPS miss is not surprising, but dropping this much seems like an overreaction unless I'm missing something. They would seem to have a lot in their favor:

* They just launched their newest device (Eargo 5) very late in Q2, so one would expect significant revenue lift in Q3 and into the holidays once they put a marketing push behind the new product.
* [Early reviews](https://www.engadget.com/eargos-latest-smart-hearing-aids-bring-a-much-needed-hearing-test-160001810.html) on the new device have been strong as far as I can tell (overall their line of products seem to be well reviewed and very competitive on price). 
* On their Q2 presentation they alluded to making inroads with payer relationships. 
* Even without better payer coverage, [Biden's recent executive order](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/biden-order-takes-aim-at-high-cost-of-hearing-aids-calls-for-otc-sales/603114/) calling for OTC sales of hearing aids and directive towards fair pricing would seem to provide some future tailwinds for a company like Eargo, who is already significantly lower priced than higher end hearing aids. 
* The total TAM should be expanding. Its estimated that 17% of Gen Xers and 10% of Millennials [already experience some level of hearing loss](https://www.ameritasinsight.com/wellness/hearing/why-millennials-and-generation-z-employees-have-hearing-loss). It is naturally expected that those numbers will grow with age. A digitally-forward, stigma free hearing aid solution would seem like an ideal product for those generations.

*\[…\] it’s not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it’s so limited.*

*Co-Diagnostics certainly has been  doing a good job lately as it’s been growing earnings more than most  other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is low because  investors think this strong earnings performance might be less  impressive moving forward.*

*Shares in Co-Diagnostics are going to  need a lot more upward momentum to get the company’s P/E out of its  slump. Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you  should sell your stock isn’t sensible, however it can be a practical  guide to the company’s future prospects.*

*We’ve established that Co-Diagnostics maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings, as expected.*

The company, which has risen to prominence even  among non-*[*healthcare*](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/healthcare/)  *investors because of its COVID-19 diagnostic products, said that its  revenue was $27.4 million.

### Methodology

For each stock from NASDAQ and NYSE scores are calculated for each of the following areas:

* Valuation
* Profitability
* Growth
* Health

The scores are calculated using the indicators shown in  colored boxes above. For instance, to assess stock’s profitability,  Return on Assets (**ROA**), Return on Equity (**ROE**) and **Net Margin**  are taken into account. The algorithm looks up the value of ROA in  every stock belonging to the same industry and compares it against the  analyzed stock, providing a final rank: if there are 20 stocks and 5 of  them have higher ROA, then the ROA-associated score is (20-5)/20 \* 100 =  75, meaning that the ROA is better than in 75% of stocks. We want ROA  to be higher than in the other companies; sometimes, however, we want  the indicator’s value to be lower than in peers, as is the case with  Price to Book ratio (**P/B**).

In the next step, the mean score across ROA, ROE and Net  Margin is calculated. Similar calculations are done for stock’s  Valuation, Growth and Health. The algorithm starts with Valuation score,  requiring it is at least 50/100. Then it proceeds with Profitability,  Growth and Health scores, each time requiring the score to be 50 or  higher. Finally, the mean value across all four areas of interest are  calculated. Only highest ranking stocks subjected to further manual  inspection.

&amp;#x200B;

### Definitions

**P/E** (Price to Earnings ratio): the ratio of a  company’s share (stock) price to the company’s earnings per share (EPS).  A high Price-Earning ratio indicates that investors are expecting  higher growth of company’s earnings in the future compared to companies  with a lower Price-Earning ratio. A low Price-Earning ratio may indicate  either that a company may currently be undervalued or that the company  is doing exceptionally well relative to its past trends. The long-term  average P/E for the S&amp;P 500 is around 16x.

**P/B** (Price to Book ratio): compares a company’s  current market value to its book value (where book value is the value of  all assets owned by a company). Except in the case of a small minority  of companies, like property companies and investment trusts that are  asset-based, book values can bear little or no relationship to true  values of the companies. In many of today’s companies, their most  valuable assets are not shown on the balances sheet and are therefore  not necessarily reflected in the company’s book value (e,g, copyrights,  intellectual capital). Despite the limitations of the price-book ratio,  academic research has repeatedly shown that stocks with low price-book  ratios tend to outperform stocks with high price-book ratios in the  United States and other stock exchanges.

**EV/EBITDA**: a popular valuation multiple used to  determine the fair market value of a company. EV stands for Enterprise  Value, while EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes,  depreciation, and amortization. A key advantage of EV/EBITDA is that it  is independent of the capital structure (i.e. the mixture of debt and  equity). Therefore this multiple can be used to compare companies with  different levels of debt. It also avoids the significant shortcoming of  the P/E ratio which can be materially affected by the level of leverage  in the company. As of Jan. 2020, the average EV/EBITDA for the S&amp;P  500 was 14.20. As a general guideline, an EV/EBITDA value below 10 is  commonly interpreted as healthy and above average by analysts and  investors.

**ROA** (Return On Assets): shows how profitable a  company’s assets are in generating revenue. It’s a useful number for  comparing competing companies in the same industry. The higher the ROA  number, the better, because the company is earning more money on less  investment. ROAs over 5 are generally considered good.

**ROE** (Return ON Equity): measures the profitability of  a business in relation to the equity. ROEs of at least 15–20 are  generally considered good. Whereas ROE compares net income to the net  assets of the company, ROA compares net income to the company’s assets  alone, without deducting its liabilities. Sometimes an extremely high  ROE is a good thing if net income is extremely large compared to equity  because a company’s performance is so strong. However, an extremely high  ROE is often due to a small equity account compared to net income,  which indicates risk.

**Net Margin** (Net Profit Margin): Net profit margin or  net margin is the percentage of net income generated from a company’s  revenue. Net income is often called the bottom line for a company or the  net profit. It helps investors assess if a company’s management is  generating enough profit from its sales and whether operating costs and  overhead costs are being contained. Net profit margin can be influenced  by one-off items such as the sale of an asset, which would temporarily  boost profits.

**EPS** (Earnings Per Share): calculated as net income  (also known as profits or earnings) divided by available shares. The  resulting number serves as an indicator of a company’s profitability.  The higher a company’s EPS, the more profitable it is considered to be.  What counts as a “good” EPS will depend on factors such as the recent  performance of the company, the performance of its competitors, and the  expectations of the analysts who follow the stock. Sometimes, a company  might report growing EPS, but the stock might decline in price if  analysts were expecting an even higher number.

**Quick ratio**: a ratio between quickly available or  liquid assets and current liabilities. A company with a quick ratio of  less than 1 cannot currently fully pay back its current liabilities. In  general, the higher the ratio, the greater the company’s liquidity.

**Current ratio**: a liquidity ratio that measures  whether a company has enough resources to meet its short-term  obligations. It compares a firm’s current assets to its current  liabilities. Acceptable current ratios vary from industry to industry.  In many cases, a creditor would consider a high current ratio to be  better than a low current ratio, because a high current ratio indicates  that the company is more likely to pay the creditor back. Large current  ratios are not always a good sign for investors. If the company’s  current ratio is too high it may indicate that the company is not  efficiently using its current assets or its short-term financing  facilities.

**D/E** (Debt to Equity ratio): used to evaluate a  company’s financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company’s  total liabilities by its shareholder equity. In other words, it measures  the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt  versus wholy owned funds. Higher-leverage ratios tend to indicate a  company or stock with higher risk to shareholders. What counts as a  “good” debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio will depend on the nature of the  business and its industry. Generally speaking, a D/E ratio below 1.0  would be seen as relatively safe, whereas ratios of 2.0 or higher would  be considered risky.

**LTDebt/Eq** (Long Term Debt to Equity ratio):  calculated by taking the company’s long-term debt and dividing it by the  book value of common equity. Similar to D/E, but long term debt is  applied there (debt that matures in more than one year).

**PEG** (price/earnings to growth ratio): a valuation  metric for determining the relative trade-off between the price of a  stock, the earnings generated per share (EPS), and the company’s  expected growth. PEG is a widely employed indicator of a stock’s  possible true value. Similar to PE ratios, a lower PEG means that the  stock is undervalued more. It is favored by many over the price/earnings  ratio because it also accounts for growth. Criticisms of the PEG ratio  include that it is an oversimplified ratio that fails to usefully relate  the price/earnings ratio to growth because it fails to factor in return  on equity (ROE) or similar factors. On the other hand, the PEG ratio  can offer a suggestion of whether a company’s high P/E ratio reflects an  excessively high stock price or is a reflection of promising growth  prospects for the company.

**P/S** (Price to Sales ratio): a valuation ratio that  shows a company’s market capitalization divided by the company’s sales  for the previous 12 months. It is a measure of the value investors are  receiving from a company’s stock by indicating how much are they are  paying for the stock per dollar of the company’s sales. Analysts prefer  to see a lower number for the ratio. A ratio of less than 1 indicates  that investors are paying less than $1 per $1 of the company’s sales.  Any number higher than 4 is commonly considered unfavorable.

**Gross margin**: a difference between revenue and cost  of goods sold (COGS), divided by revenue. In other words, it is the  sales revenue a company retains after incurring the direct costs  associated with producing the goods it sells, and the services it  provides. The higher the gross margin, the more capital a company  retains on each dollar of sales, which it can then use to pay other  costs or satisfy debt obligations.

**Piotroski F-Score**: a discrete score between zero and  nine that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a  firm’s financial position. The Piotroski Score is used to determine the  best value stocks, with nine being the best and zero being the worst.

**Altman Z-Score**: the output of a credit-strength test  that gauges a publicly-traded manufacturing company’s likelihood of  bankruptcy. It uses profitability, leverage, liquidity, solvency, and  activity to predict whether a company has a high probability of becoming  insolvent. A score below 1.8 means it’s likely the company is headed  for bankruptcy, while companies with scores above 3 are not likely to go  bankrupt. Investors can use Altman Z-scores to determine whether they  should buy or sell a stock if they’re concerned about the company’s  underlying financial strength. Investors may consider purchasing a stock  if its Altman Z-Score value is closer to 3 and selling or shorting a  stock if the value is closer to 1.8.

**Div Yield** (Dividend Yield): a ratio (dividend/price)  that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative  to its stock price.

**Payout ratio**: a financial metric showing the  proportion of earnings a company pays its shareholders in the form of  dividends, expressed as a percentage of the company’s total earnings.

**Beta**: a measure of a stock’s volatility in relation  to the overall market. By definition, the market, such as the S&amp;P  500 Index, has a beta of 1.0, and individual stocks are ranked according  to how much they deviate from the market. A stock that swings more than  the market over time has a beta above 1.0. If a stock moves less than  the market, the stock’s beta is less than 1.0. High-beta stocks are  supposed to be riskier but provide higher return potential; low-beta  stocks pose less risk but also lower returns.

**Volatility**: represents how large an asset’s prices swing around the mean price.

**MRQ**: Most Recent Quarter.

**TTM**: Trailing Twelve Months.

**Volume**: the total number of shares that are actually traded (bought and sold) during a period of time.

A California judge on Friday ruled that a 2020 ballot measure that exempted ride-share and food delivery drivers from a state labor law is unconstitutional as it infringed on the legislature’s power to set standards at the workplace.

Proposition 22 is unconstitutional as “it limits the power of a future Legislature to define app-based drivers as workers subject to workers’ compensation law”, which makes the entire ballot measure “unenforceable”, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch wrote in the ruling.

Gig economy companies including Uber, Lyft, Doordash and Instacart were pushing to keep drivers’ independent contractor status, albeit with additional benefits.

The ballot measure was meant to cement app-based food delivery and ride-hail drivers’ status as independent contractors, not employees.

Known as Proposition 22, it marked the culmination of years of legal and legislative wrangling over a business model that has introduced millions of people to the convenience of ordering food or a ride with the push of a button.","[CNBC] California superior judge on late Friday ruled that a 2020 ballot measure, Prop 22, that exempted ride-share and food delivery drivers from a state labor law is unconstitutional as it infringed on the legislature’s power to set standards at the workplace.",1629514163

Recent news- GoHealth and GoodRx Announce Exclusive Medicare Agreement

CHICAGO and SANTA MONICA, Calif., Aug. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- GoHealth, Inc. (GoHealth) (NASDAQ: GOCO), a leading health insurance marketplace and Medicare-focused digital health company, and GoodRx, Inc. (NASDAQ: GDRX), America's leading resource for healthcare savings, today announced an exclusive agreement to bring GoHealth's Medicare enrollment and engagement solutions directly to GoodRx users on the GoodRx platform.

Of the nearly 20 million people who come to GoodRx every month looking for savings, millions of them have Medicare, based on GoodRx's internal analysis, while many others qualify for the program each year as they age in. GoodRx consumers who want to explore Medicare coverage options and understand potential benefits or savings will be able to access information about GoHealth's market-leading Medicare plan selection solutions. Those who enroll in a Medicare plan through GoHealth have access to a suite of healthcare services to further improve health outcomes. For instance, GoHealth members will receive ongoing engagement and education around pharmacy options and prescription savings related to their Medicare Advantage plan to maximize the value of their prescription plan benefits.

GoHealth consumers will also have access to GoodRx prescription discounts on GoHealth's Encompass platform. GoodRx prescription discounts can provide savings of up to 80% from the pharmacy retail price and are accepted at over 70,000 pharmacies nationwide, including Albertsons, CVS, Kroger, Rite Aid, Walmart and Walgreens.

""We're excited to bring GoodRx into GoHealth's robust ecosystem of strategic partners. Prescription costs are a major financial barrier for many people, especially Medicare members, and GoodRx's platform is greatly beneficial to finding savings for our members. Through this strategic partnership, we are giving our members affordable choices to further improve health outcomes, while also helping GoodRx's users find and enroll in the right Medicare coverage plan that fits their needs, a real win-win,"" said Ben Miller, Senior Vice President, Strategic Partnerships at GoHealth.

GoodRx is one of the many strategic partners GoHealth has added to its Encompass technology, a proprietary engagement platform that maximizes members' utilization of their benefits once enrolled in a plan, ensuring that members receive the care they need. This agreement is part of GoHealth's ongoing commitment to improve access to healthcare in America.

""The strategic partnership with GoHealth adds critical information to our platform that helps users as they seek to understand and navigate the complex world of Medicare,"" said Doug Hirsch, co-CEO and co-founder of GoodRx. ""The level of Medicare expertise and service that GoHealth provides, combined with our prescription savings value proposition, creates immense value all around.""

One of the sayings of David Gardner of The Motley Fool. If youre a day trader or short term investor you need to remember that the stock market ALWAYS goes down

Seriously. You can take that and test it. By any stock. Any of them. And nine times out of 10 no matter when you bought it- will be in the red by the end of the week

Stocks always go down. They say not to buy high and sell low but you're always buying high. At any moment you're buying a stock higher than it will be later in that week.. because in the short term they always go down. So it's impossible NOT to buy a stock high

And in many cases impossible not to sell it low. There's plenty of examples of a stock that never goes back up no matter how long you hold it. Look at tesla. It was steadily increasing for months until it hit $840 before it dropped. For anyone trying to follow the ""advice"" of ""just hold it"" instead of cutting their losses they would have lost tons of money and it never went back up..

More examples how it's impossible not to buy high and often times impossible not to sell low

The only times you can actually make money is if you hold it for a very long time. And being that it's impossible to beat the market you generally won't see that much rate of return. Unless you prove to be a better investor than the experts at Wall Street then the chances of making any serious money unless you already invested serious money would be pretty low. You have to have at least a few million dollars in the stock market to reliably make anything tangible..",Remember: the stock market almost always goes down faster than it goes up in the short term,1629395334

6662,investing,scarberia123,"For a long time, gene and cell therapies were a treatment option for the future. Now, the pace of development is moving at breakneck speed, with a number of firsts and $14.1 billion in financing collected over the initial half of the year.

The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine has documented the “acceleration on all fronts” in a new report looking at the first half of 2021.

Most notably was Intellia’s demonstration of CRISPR gene-editing in humans through phase 1 data for patients with transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. But that’s not all for regenerative medicine, which includes cell and gene therapies, gene editing and tissue-based therapies.

Companies developing these therapies have collected $14.1 billion in the first half alone, which is 71% of what was raised during all of 2020. The alliance called this surge the strongest half on record. 2020 already broke financing records, with $20 billion, and the report suggests 2021 could exceed that total.

Cell-based immuno-oncology has for the first time surpassed gene therapy in financing, notching $6.6 billion compared to $6.4 billion, respectively. The broader category of cell therapy, including stem cell treatments for Parkinson's disease, meanwhile picked up $1.1 billion.

Regulatory milestones

Gene therapies and gene-modified cell therapy products are on track to notch the highest annual number of regulatory approvals. Three have already been approved. Bluebird bio’s Skysona nabbed an EU nod for the rare neuromuscular disease cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy. Bristol Myers Squibb and bluebird’s multiple myeloma CAR-T drug Abecma was cleared by the FDA in late March. And Bristol Myers’ long-awaited CAR-T liso-cel, now called Breyanzi, was approved in February.

Waiting in the regulatory queue in the U.S. and EU is Johnson &amp; Johnson and Legend Bio’s cilta-cel in multiple myeloma, which will compete with Abecma. Other companies have approvals pending around the world.

Even with these approvals, however, cell and gene therapies face hurdles once they are cleared for the market. Bluebird bio, for instance, has pulled back from European markets after failing to reach a consensus on pricing for the one-time treatment Zynteglo.

The pipeline is nevertheless filled to the brim with new therapies. The report counted 1,320 industry-sponsored trials underway worldwide, including 158 that are in phase 3. Academic and other research is responsible for an additional 1,328 non-industry trials including 85 late-stage studies.

Indications run the gamut of diseases, but are mostly concentrated in oncology for the industry-sponsored trials, followed by central nervous system (CNS) disorders and rare genetic diseases. Academic research similarly focuses on oncology, followed by infectious diseases and CNS.

CAR-T therapies, which take a patients’ own cells and power them up to fight cancer before being returned to the body, have been particularly dominate in R&amp;D. Abecma is one example, but the J&amp;J-Legend cilta-cel showed some promising data in June, with a 98% overall response rate in multiple myeloma. The therapy is currently being reviewed by EU and U.S. regulators, with a decision expected later this year.


More readouts are expected from Precision BioSciences and CRISPR Therapeutics, which are working on separate BCMA-targeted CAR-T therapies.

The alliance counts 566 companies as developing regenerative medicines and advanced therapies in the U.S. and 588 industry-sponsored trials with U.S. sites.

I like to use SoFi for investments and like their automated investing feature. Do you think it would be wise to keep our wedding funds into a conservative account, rather than just sit in a normal bank account which is losing due to inflation? The conservative account has 100% bonds. 

I originally had it in a moderately conservative account which is 30% stocks, 70% bonds but noticed I was losing money due to the current market. For this particular account, I’m not comfortable with too much risk or the prospect of losing more than I gain. So I switched it to 100% bonds. 

Was this a wise choice to put our house savings into a lower risk investment account rather than just have it sit in a regular bank account? Or should I just transfer it to our savings account for our regular bank? Also, was I smart to switch it from 30% stocks 70% bonds to 100% bonds to minimize risk?

If you did not know a Series EE bonds is suppose to double in value in 20 years. The rates are pretty low for these bonds. The earliest bonds I have is 1996 going all the way to 2011. Some bonds are close to maturity where others basically have very little interest. Final Maturity for a 2011 bond is around 2041 meaning ill be 45 years old. An example I have is a bond at face value of $250 in 2011, after going to irs.gov it is valued at $265ish after 10 years. 
I calculated the overall cash value of my bonds as of today is around $6,800. Which could really help buy a property. 

My overall question is should I cash my bonds and put it all towards a down payment? Seems that id make more money generating income from a property over the long term.

I'm in a situation with a masters program application a couple months from now where I'll need to prove I have a certain amount of money via a bank statement. Basically since tuition is free in this country (Norway) they require you to provide bank statements showing that you have enough money to support yourself (they won't accept brokerage accounts). I have more than enough money saved and invested, I just don't want to make a taxable event by selling assets simply to get cash in my account, pull a statement, and then put it right back in the brokerage. An alternative I found sounds tempting: withdraw contributions from my Roth IRA, get it in my checking account temporarily, then put it right back in the Roth. From what I've read, this is considered a ""rollover"" into the same account and is okay with the IRS so long as it's returned within 60 days. So my question is, is this a reasonable alternative to get cash in my account temporarily, or is there something I'm missing that may bite me in the ass?

Today as I sipped my coffee in my backyard I was keeping my ear to the streets as I normally do in the latest financial gossip. I’ve recently heard about the new craze that is seemingly lingering longer than I thought it would. Non-fungible tokens or NFTs are being ushered into the millennial and zoomer populations by creatively bankrupt Hollywood has-beens and noteworthy celebrities. Lindsay Lohan and other bold innovators of the investor class like Soulja Boy and Mark Cuban. Both of them are well known for their reliable and professional investment advice and business savvy. Cuban who has recently been an avid promoter of the Wallstreet bets pump and dump movement and Soulja Boy who was recently sued by Nintendo over his cheap Chinese knock-off video game consoles violated more than a dozen copyright laws. 

Honestly, my first impression of these NFT’s is a bit on the cynical side. Perhaps it is just my overactive imagination paired with a sense of dark humor. But I truly see people buying these NFT’s as a sign of the apocalypse. The concept wasn’t totally foreign to me. Video gamers have been using digital inventory for real-world currency for a long time. Online communities tend to have websites that facilitate in real-world trade of money for in-game items or digital loot drops from other players. Online trading card games have had digital copies of rare cards that are commonly traded for money too. Online party hats in a video game called Runescape sold for 7 thousand USD between private sellers. But are we really at a stage in the economic cycle where the best course of action is to buy digital content to pad your portfolio? 

Are we really at a moment in history where people are actually purchasing a Lindsey Lohan NFT for 17 thousand dollars? Is dancing GIFS of Mark Cuban to your portfolio really going to be a solid item for your child’s financial future? Will AMC one day let us pay for our movies with Zuckerberg GIFs or pre-expulsion Trump Tweets? Will canceled celebrities have to sell their NFTs in shady alleys and on street corners within flash drives? I don’t truly know and I don’t want to pretend to know the answer. While it’s really easy to cherry-pick from the dregs of the Hollywood influencer types. There is real money being moved by major players in the digital market. A GIF of a cat-poptart hybrid called “Nyan-Cat” sold for 450 thousand dollars and Kings of Leon’s album sold for 6 million dollars respectively. 

In both instances, the content is already released to the public. The owners don’t collect any revenue or royalties anytime the GIFs are used or the albums are played. In fact, the only thing gained is a sense of ownership within our digital world. While the world stands on the brink of opening up, the flood of money into online and virtual assets is staggering. Why buy real estate when you can buy virtual real estate? There was an old saying by Mark Twain. “Buy land, they aren’t making any more of it.” I can’t help but reflect on that as I see more and more of the virtual space be paved. How much farther into technology is society really trying to dive in and how much are people really willing to invest into this frontier? 

On one level this seems to be a desperate attempt for people with influence to make money from their followers by truly trying to offer them the clout of virtual asset ownership instead of conventionally making products to sell to them. On another level, this is pop culture and pop art manifesting its own free market. I don’t believe the Government will get involved yet in a major capacity on either side of the pendulum either. I think the government trying to restrict the sale of virtual art is about as likely as them releasing their own NFTs of what’s within area 51 or who killed JFK. 

But on another level, I also think that NFTs are a way where people can support their content creators and help support them in more meaningful ways beyond a tip. Instead of donations and handouts, people are now able to get collectibles and memorabilia that might hold and maintain some value as opposed to nothing. We live in a world where artists and entertainers stream a variety of content to their fans and audiences. The idea that the words we utter, the pictures we take, and our online memories can all be bought and sold are a new chapter in this digital economy.

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened a probe into Tesla’s Autopilot software, citing the cars’ repeated collisions with parked emergency vehicles.

The NHTSA investigation will cover Tesla Models Y, X, S, and 3 vehicles released from 2014 through 2021. The federal agency says since 2018 it has logged 11 incidents (which include 17 injuries and one fatality) in which Tesla vehicles using the company’s Autopilot features, like Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, have crashed into stationary emergency vehicles. The agency says most of these incidents took place after dark, with the software ignoring scene control measures including warning lights, flares, cones, and an illuminated arrow board.

The investigation will “assess the technologies and methods used to monitor, assist, and enforce the driver’s engagement with the dynamic driving task during Autopilot operation,” according to NHTSA’s notes.

AN NHTSA SPOKESPERSON REMINDED THE PUBLIC THAT NO COMMERCIAL VEHICLES CAN DRIVE THEMSELVES
A spokesperson for the agency said that the investigation was in its preliminary stages and primarily concerned with uncovering additional information about the incidents. The spokesperson noted that the public should be aware that no commercially available cars are able to drive themselves, and vehicles always require a human in control at all times.

The inability of driving-assistance software from Tesla and other automakers to spot parked emergency vehicles is well known. Experts told Wired in 2018 that the likely cause is that these systems are programmed to mostly ignore stationary objects, otherwise they might react to all sorts of items on the side of roads, from signs to buildings.

Wired’s report notes that both Tesla and Volvo’s driving assist manuals warn drivers about this problem. As Tesla’s says: “Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cannot detect all objects and may not brake/decelerate for stationary vehicles, especially in situations when you are driving over 50 mph (80 km/h) and a vehicle you are following moves out of your driving path and a stationary vehicle or object is in front of you instead.”

The NHTSA has stepped up its scrutiny of Tesla in recent months as the company’s Autopilot software has been the focus of an increasing number of crashes. Many industry experts have criticized Tesla for its marketing of the software, which often suggests that human oversight of the vehicle is optional.

In April, senators urged the NHTSA to take “corrective actions” against Tesla and prevent misuse of its driving-assist software, and in June the agency issued new rules requiring companies like Tesla and Alphabet’s Waymo to report all incidents involving such systems.",US government opens probe into Tesla Autopilot crashes with emergency vehicles,1629125803

Let’s talk about the timeline on Phase 3 for Endoxifen. FDA 505(b)(2) may bring Endoxifen to market without the need of Phase 3.

As discussed in this video: [https://youtu.be/rmuCfrJ8Se4](https://youtu.be/rmuCfrJ8Se4)

\&gt; \[Interviewer\]can you shed some colour on what maybe a phase 3 study may look like … since the FDA is already familiar with Tamoxifen and it’s outcomes…?

\&gt; \[Dr Quay\] .. first of all it’s very hard to answer that, but I think one of the things we have talked about in the past is that there’s a pathway called 505(b)(2) which allows you to submit applications for metabolites of drugs that are already approved. There are some special aspects of that package … you’re allowed to reference the data with the primary drug, you’re typically allowed to do one instead of two controlled clinical trials, and you typically get 7 years of market exclusivity independent of your patent situation. So it’s a nice model and we’ve publicly said that this is our target. We’ve obviously not had conversations with the FDA about all of the aspects of our programs qualifying for 505(b)(2), but I mean I think that’s how I would answer that question.

\*\*What is 505(b)(2) ?\*\*

The 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) is a streamlined NDA process in which the applicant relies upon one or more investigations conducted by someone other than the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained right of reference. In other words, the 505(b)(2) pathway enables investigators and/or manufacturers to apply for approval without having to repeat all the drug development work done for an innovator drug.

$238mil in backlog orders.

**SCOTTSDALE, AZ, August 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE)** — AMMO, Inc. (Nasdaq: POWW, POWWP) (“AMMO” or the “Company”), a leading vertically integrated producer of high-performance ammunition and components and operator of GunBroker.com, the largest online marketplace serving the firearms and shooting sports industries today announced results for its first quarter of fiscal 2022 ended June 30, 2021.

**First Quarter Fiscal 2022 versus First Quarter Fiscal 2021:**

●Net revenues increased 360% year-over-year to $44.5 million ●Marketplace revenue was $12.3 million reflecting the acquisition of GunBroker.com ●Gross profit margin was 42.7% compared to 11.1% ●Net income was $9.5 million compared to a net loss of $3.1 million ●Diluted EPS of $0.08 compared to ($0.07); Adjusted EPS of $0.13 compared to ($0.01) ●Adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million versus a loss of $0.3 million ●Backlog of $238 million

“We delivered solid first quarter results, exceeding estimates for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Core ammunition sales were up more than three-fold reflecting strong underlying demand for our unique, high-performance products. We also added over $12 million of high-margin Marketplace revenue with the GunBroker.com acquisition that closed in April,” said Fred Wagenhals, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AMMO, Inc. “Integration efforts are advancing on schedule and we are working on several major initiatives to further accelerate growth across our powerful Marketplace platform. Construction of our new manufacturing facility is also on track and we continue to make progress with new product development and government contracts. I am very proud of our team’s commitment and execution in driving significant value for all stakeholders.”

**First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Results**

Net revenues of $44.5 million were up 360% versus last year driven by strong growth in Ammunition and incremental revenue from the acquisition of GunBroker.com. Ammunition sales totaled $28.4 million compared to $6.4 million in last year’s first quarter, an increase of 342%. Marketplace revenue was $12.3 million reflecting the GunBroker.com business we acquired on April 30, 2021.

Gross profit was $19.0 million in the first quarter versus $1.1 million in the year-earlier period due to the increased sales of Ammunition coupled with the addition of our Marketplace segment, which included GunBroker.com. Gross profit margin was 42.7% in the first quarter compared to 11.1% in last year’s first quarter reflecting the impact of our higher margin Marketplace revenue.

Operating expenses were $9.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to $3.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase was attributable to operating the GunBroker.com business for approximately two months, higher commission payments stemming from growth in our Ammunition sales, higher stock-based compensation expense, and professional fees related to the acquisition of GunBroker.com. As a percent of sales, operating expenses declined to 20.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 from 40.0% in the year-earlier period reflecting operating leverage, manufacturing scale and the mix shift in favor of higher margin Marketplace revenues.

Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was $9.7 million compared to an operating loss of $2.8 million in last year’s first quarter.

Net income was $9.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to a net loss of $3.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income available to common shareholders was $9.2 million or $0.08 per fully diluted share versus a net loss of $3.1 million and ($0.07) per fully diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Adjusted net income per share was $0.13 in versus an adjusted per share loss of ($0.01).

Adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.3 million a year earlier.

**Outlook**

We are increasing our fiscal 2022 revenue guidance from $190 million to $210 million, including reiterating our expectation for second quarter fiscal 2022 revenue of at least $51 million. We estimate third quarter fiscal 2022 revenue will be approximately $60 million. We are increasing our Adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2022 from $65 million to $70 million.","$POWW blew away earnings again, and raised 2022 Rev Guidance!",1629159858
6959,investing,cookingboy,"SpaceX raised its most recent round earlier this year at a $75B valuation. I currently have an opportunity to buy shares at $850/share, or roughly $150B valuation, through an SPV (special purpose vehicle). Considering it's a private company very minimal amount of information is available. As impressed as I am when it comes to their technology I do think there is a very good reason that seasoned institutional investors flooding with cash still only valued them at $75B just a few months ago. 

What complicates things a little is that I had bought shares before at a lower valuation (roughly $55B), but whenever I see new development from the company I regret my decision for not having put in more money.

2. 25%: **The Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Index** (Commodity Futures, precious metals)

4. 20%: **S&amp;P Global Infrastructure Index** (kind of like #3 but more focused on utilities and energy, $NEE, $ENB, $SO). 
5. 20%: **The Bloomberg Barclays US Government Inflation-Linked 1-10 Year Bond Index** (TIPS) 

This seems like a decent inflation protection fund. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.23%. I'm not sure how expense ratios work, but I would guess that means there's the also the expense ratios behind these 5 funds as well? So the overall expense ratio might actually be a lot more?

I have 70% in US Stock Index (55% SP500, 15% small/mid cap index), 20% in international, and 10% in this ""Real Asset Fund"". 

Do you all think that is wise? I feel adding this fund might help me take advantage of rebalancing and also throw in some value. Do you think 10% is too little or too much?

She sent him $5,000 3 months ago and he helped set her up a Binance account, which he manages. She also has access to this Binance account. Today she has hit $15,000 on that account. I was stumped at this 300% return so on questioning her further she says that almost everybody who is investing through this broker, which is a majority of her friend group, is making massive returns.

For example, one of her close friends took a loan of $40,000 at the start of this year, and is now regularly withdrawing $20,000 every month since past 3 months.

Another close friend of hers in the same friend group is profiting more than $100,000 a year through Dave Clarkson.

She said I should invest too, so I started doing my due research online. I found out they are not registered with [FCA UK](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/investment-center).

Using my web development background, I found there are 2 other exactly similar websites to the [Investment Center UK website](https://investmentcenter.co.uk/) (just different branding):

1. [Walton Chase](https://waltonchase.com/)
2. [Top Market Cap](https://topmarketcap.com/)

And the [reviews for Walton Chase](https://au.trustpilot.com/review/waltonchase.com) do not look so good. 

Red flags I can identify:

1. The above reviews for Walton Chase (which seems like the same firm)
2. My friend sent me the UK phone number of Walton Chase - his profile picture is just a stock bitcoin image.
3. I cannot find much on the internet if i google for Dave Clarkson, or his phone number or about The Investment Center.
4. They are now calling her almost twice every week asking to invest more money.
5. On some posts on the internet I can see that they claim they have 20 years of experience in the investment sector, but their website was only active since March 2020 (using Way Back Machine).
6. 300% return in 3 months !

&amp;#x200B;

I have discussed this with my friend and she has discussed with her other friends, and they think that as these are very high risk investments, they have very high returns, and also very high chances of losing the investment. So people who lose their investments end up posting bad reviews online. My friend and her friend group are not really convinced this is a scam and want to keep investing.

China’s market regulator issued draft rules on Tuesday aimed at stopping unfair competition on the internet, as Beijing continues its broad crack down on the country’s technology sector.

The rules published by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) cover a wide range of areas from prohibitions on the way companies can use data to stamping out fake product reviews.

Chinese listed technology stocks in Hong Kong fell sharply on that news. Gaming giant Tencent was 3.5% lower in late morning trade, while e-commerce giant Alibaba fell 2.5%.

SAMR’s latest rules continue Beijing’s regulatory assault on China’s technology giants.

Here are some of the other key rules outlined:

Operators should not provide false data, such as the number of clicks on a piece of content;
Operators should not conceal negative reviews and only promote positive reviews;
Internet platforms should not use data, algorithms and other technical means to influence user choices, or other methods to carry out so-called traffic hijacking. This is where a company looks to redirect a user to their own website or service while they’re browsing another;
Operators should not use data and algorithms to collect and analyze competitors’ trading information.
SAMR said it could hire third-party institutions to audit data if an operator falls foul of the rules.

SAMR said it could hire third-party institutions to audit data if an operator falls foul of the rules.

The regulator is seeking public opinion on the new rules until Sept. 15. They have not yet come into effect.

However, SAMR’s draft rules highlight the market regulator’s push to tighten the laws around antitrust and competition. Earlier this year, the authority promulgated antitrust guidelines for the so-called platform economy.

The regulator has also been taking action against China’s technology giants.

Alibaba was slapped with a $2.8 billion fine in April as a result of an anti-monopoly probe, and SAMR is currently investigating food delivery firm Meituan for “suspected monopolistic practices.”

And last month, the SAMR blocked Tencent’s plan to merge video game streaming sites Huya and DouYu on antitrust concerns.","China seeks to tighten rules on unfair internet competition, sending tech shares lower",1629182049

Then just bleed down my savings using it to pay my mo th to month expenses while a very large portion of my paycheck flows into my retirement accounts, but I also like the feeling of having the mo ey available medium term instead of locking it all away in retirement accounts where I can't touch it for 30+ years.

I'm just conservative with my cash to a fault and it's obviously been hurting me in this market, but it makes it extra difficult to make a major change to my strategy (or lack thereof) now that everything from real estate to equities feels overpriced. Is that just a fallacy?

7033,investing,futureisathreat,"TLDR: Invested in a range of automatic investing platforms (mostly robo-advisors). Made everything aggressive (100% stocks if possible). Every 10-12 weeks I'm switching out the worst performing for something new.

First 10 week results:

1. Titan: **+7.03%**
2. SoFi: **+4.19%**
3. M1 ""Social Responsibility"" Pie: **+4.07%**
4. M1 ""Ultra Aggressive"" Pie: **+3.01%**
5. Wealthfront: **+1.5%**
6. Betterment: **+1.31%**
7. SigFig: **-.34%**

In that same time period, popular ETFs performed pretty well:

* VTI had a **4.25%** increase (Total stock market)
* VOO had a **4.41%** increase (S&amp;P 500)
* QQQ had a **9.65%** increase (Nasdaq 100)

I'm hoping the next cycle will produce better results vs the ETFs.

The purpose of this post is to share my experiences with the different platforms and to help myself find the best platform for me (if any).

This performance is from 5/22 to 7/31

I'm really only following a few rules so I could keep my tracking accurate:

* No deposits during the cycle
* No withdrawals during the cycle
* No manual rebalancing
* After the cycle, swap out at least the worst-performing platform.

1 . Titan: **+7.03%**

1. Actively managed stock portfolio
2. Invests in about 20(?) hand-picked stocks
3. Fees
   1. $5 per month under 10k
   2. 1% over 10k
   3. Can be reduced...
4. 4 Investment Options
   1. Flagship (Large)
   2. Opportunities (Small / Under the radar)
      1. Locked behind 2 referrals
   3. Offshore (International)
      1. Locked behind 2 referrals
   4. Crypto (new)
5. The app is minimal and simple, like their investment choices.

* I think Titan is the newest of all the list of platforms here and it has performed above expectations. There aren't many options, but I kinda like that, but only because they've been performing well.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Trying out the crypto management

2 . SoFi Automated Investing: **+4.19%**

1. Robo Advisor
2. 5 Simple Investment Options ranging from Conservative (100% bonds) to Aggressive (100% Stocks)
3. No Fees
4. Part of what they invest in is their own ETFs, but I believe they waive the fees? Don't quote me on that.
5. The app is awesome.
   1. It's amazing to see all your financial stuff in one place.

* I've been very happy with the SoFi platform as a whole. The automated investing has performed a bit better than expected and it's easy to use.
* In the last 10 weeks, I've started using SoFi for almost everything.
   * Money - Switched to use as my main bank (no stupid fees like other banks... looking at you BofA)
   * Credit Card - 2% back on everything
   * Invest - Opened 3 investment accounts
      * Active - You pick the stocks (Kinda like Robinhood)
      * Automated - Robo-advisor
      * Crypto
   * Relay Connections
      * Budgeting / Tracking sorta like Mint
      * You can connect different accounts and track your spending (Including other investment accounts)
   * Credit Score monitoring - Every week it updates

3/4 . M1 - Social Responsibility and Ultra Aggressive Pies: SR: **+4.07%,** UA: **+3.01%**

1. Active investing
2. You get to create things called ""Pies"" which allows you to allocate percentages for each ""Slice"" of the pie and you can easily rebalance to match your initial allocations.
   1. Slices can be other Pies, ETFs, or Stocks (afaik)
3. There are pre-built pies called ""Expert Pies"" which is what I'm using
   1. They range from General Investing to Hedge Fund mimicking to Dividends
4. No Fees
5. The app is easy enough to understand and is getting better.
   1. Managing multiple pies seemed a little bit of a hassle the first time I tried to do it.
   2. Also, understanding pie creation could use a class or video. You can have Pies within Pies within Pies.

* Pretty interesting concept compared to the others. Seems possible to match the stocks and allocations of what other advisors are doing and you get that all for no fees.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Rebalancing my Pie
   * Adding an ARK Expert Pie slice... yolo?

5 . Wealthfront: **+1.5%**

1. Robo advisor
2. Tax Loss Harvesting
   1. If your investment dips, it sells some of your ETFs and buys similar ones to show a loss on your taxes.
   2. Seems good for high earners, but not as useful for lower tax bracket incomes.
3. .25% Advisor fee over a certain amount... can be increased
4. The app is simple and allocations are easy to change.

* The main benefit of Wealthfront is the TLH.
* It allows you to modify the allocations in which you're investing and what percentage goes into each.
   * These can be stocks, bonds, socially responsible, commodities, and a good bit more... Even crypto (which are invested in investment trusts rather than straight crypto)
* TBH, kinda seems like just an M1 Pie with more limited options.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Changing about 50% of the default allocations, putting some into crypto (limits you to 10%), and some other sectors I'm interested in.

6 . Betterment: **+1.31%**

1. Robo advisor
2. 5 ""investment"" strategies. The main ones are Core (their go-to) and SRI (Socially Responsible)
3. .25% Advisor fee over a certain amount. Resets every year... can be increased
4. The app is simple but figuring out how to just change my investment strategy took like 5 minutes of searching. They should make that easier.

* It does okay. Simple platform, simple choices. I can't change the specific allocations, but it also seems like I could recreate this in M1.
   * I recently switched to the SRI and there's a total of 5 ETFs it's holding.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Switched to SRI instead of the Core to see if it performs any better and if it's worth keeping around.
   * If it continues to perform near the bottom, I'm closing it out.

7 . SigFig: **-.34%**

1. Robo advisor
2. You take a questionnaire to determine your risk level which determines your percentage of Stocks vs Bonds
3. Opens your account through TD Ameritrade
4. .25% advisor fee over $10k
5. Has Tax Loss Harvesting but it never happened for me
6. The app is simple but not very good
   1. My favorite screen is where it shows just how much it's underperforming compared to the S&amp;P 500. smh

* First off, I chose this because it's one of the oldest robo-advisors out there and has a generally good track record.
* Second... it took **3 WEEKS** for my deposit to go through so it can start investing. Every other platform took about **3** ***days***.
* Third, **-.34%???**
* So, it should be obvious by now that this one is getting dropped. Didn't have a good experience with it at all. And I expected very little to begin with.
* What I'm doing for the next cycle:
   * Withdrawing my money and closing my account... Hopefully doesn't take another 3 weeks to withdraw.
   * Trying out another investment platform. Decided on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios. A little concerned with the amount they keep in cash reserves. We'll see how it performs.

**Valuation overview:**

7115,investing,xXguitarsenXx," What is the best way of achieving your desired asset allocation by the age of your retirement?

In this example I’m going to ASSUME you want 60% equity and 40% bonds by the age of 60. The basic strategy I recommend could be used for any other asset ratio that has to be achieved by some age.

# Best way of achieving 60/40 equity/bond ratio at 60 year old?

### OPTION 1: Buying/selling to rebalance towards “age minus 20 in bonds” ratio

This strategy involves selling/buying yearly to rebalance to “*Age minus 20 in bonds.*”, and for the upcoming year buy equity/bonds in that ratio.

**Age minus 20 in bonds:**

* 20-year-olds should have 0% bonds
* 30-year-olds should have 10% bonds
* 40-year-olds should have 20% bonds
* 60-year olds should have 40%.bonds

So you end up with 60% equity and 40% bonds at 60-year-old.

### OPTION 2: Only buy 100% equity and later only buy 100% bonds

With this strategy you start by ONLY buying 100% equity, and then based on your expected earnings and the expected return for equity/bonds, you pick an age where you start buying 100% bonds, in the hopes of achieving a 60/40 equity/bond ratio at age 60!

I know that it’s a lot harder to hit a 60/40 equity/bond ratio at age 60 using this strategy, but isn’t it superior in terms of return if you manage to do it? (because equity has higher expected returns and you hold it for a longer time with this strategy)

Also, this strategy has lower transaction fee’s, because you don’t ever sell to rebalance.

# My questions:

* Which of these 2 options for asset allocation to achieve a 60/40 equity/bond allocation by age 60 do you find optimal?
* Do you think some other strategy is better?

Low rates meant these firms could use debt to expand their servers, cloud capacity and R&amp;D spending. What was once considered to be science fiction became common place within a few short years. 

Furthermore, QE meant that investors were less willing to park money in bonds, since the yields were paltry. QE increased stock market valuations, which in turn lead to firm expansion.

We are giving it away for free. 

It's a web app, Android and iOS coming soon. 

We, at weInvest, predict we will soon be paid to trade. here's an explanation behind our thesis 

in 1999, around 20% of household owned stocks. that was 15% in 1995. this number inflated due to cheap trading and UIs from the likes of etrade and others. 

prior to 1975 commission for stock trading was expensive. full-service firms competed for your business. by the mid 90s discount brokers, following deregulation, were offering trades for 40-60 dollars. this was half of what it cost before deregulation. 

in the late 90s, etrade took off with the discount brokerage model, and charged roughly $20 per trade. by 2001 they brought their commission down to $13. at that time 2/3 of their revenue came from trading commissions and the rest came from interest on cash balances. comissions continued to fall. by 2017 the average fee per trade was less than $10. a couple years later, trading was free. couple more years later, robinhood would ipo for over 30b. etrade on the other hand, was acquired by MS for  13b. etoro with a 10b spac. 

With the broker/dealers worth tens of billions, and daily revenue amounting to many millions; the free markets, the sharing economy, and the creator economy, will drive these prices down below zero. you will be paid to trade. the future is a decentralized organization, owned by the community. a DAO that allows token holders to vote on governance. 

this is the vision for weinvest. we have built a functional protocol and APIs. we have established go-to-market partnerships to begin facillitating trading cryptocurrencies for low fees, less than what you pay at coinbase. trade stocks commission free. 

stay tuned, for more to come.

For instance, companies that pay decent dividends &gt;2.5% are older more mature slower growing companies. Why would someone take buy shares in an old business whose stock price will barely move just because they get 3 4 or 5% return?

In another situation, you could invest in growth stock-- which are more volatile, however we can take advantage of their dip to buy more shares-- and get more capital appreciation.

In example one lets say you buy an old company like $KO which has gone up 18% in the last year + 3% dividend lets say you get a 21% return this year (of course and exceptional year for the market and will likely not continue giving 21% due to lack of growth.

If you bought $QQQ, you would have a much higher return 34.5% in the past year (especially over the past five years blows any dividend etf out the water) but you would have missed that because it only offers .5% dividend.

It is not hard to imagine that growth stocks will continue to outperform value because of their technological innovative advantage. So are dividends just for pure psychological motivation to keep the investor investing? Because he can yield that and then some in capital appreciation. As stated qqq up 34% this year, thats like getting a 34% dividend yield!

I was thinking about it today. In today's money your kids and grandkids can benefit from the majority of your assets, but if legal, you could also benefit future generations with smaller amounts of money with longer compounding time-frame. 

For example say you left 500k to your kids total but also split $1k for future generations and specified the money is to be held in say a total market fund for the duration until disbursement.

If you did that for the following 5 generations (assuming a generation is roughly 30 years) by the time the 5th generation received their initial $1,000 dollar investment, 1800 months would have passed. 

If that initial $1,000 averaged 6.5% over the 150 year periods between generations it would be over $17,000,000 which could be divided equally amongst all adults of that generation.

7215,investing,JKM1601,"I have spent a fair amount of time in the last couple of months coming up to speed on the CANSLIM and Minervini methods (read the books, subscribed to their tools, traded the methods for three months now). I am wondering if anyone else is following these methods and would care to share experiences/lessons. 

Here's what I think at this point: 

William O'Neil's book (How to Make Money in Stocks) was very valuable and worth the time to the read it. The parts on the use of fundamental analysis to identify high growth stocks is very useful even though similar material can be found elsewhere (Peter Lynch). What I found truly insightful were the parts on the stock price behaviour near the top of the stock's rally (breaking support, climax tops, weak action) and the inclusion of 100 graphs of successful companies from the past. I spent quite some time analyzing those. What I also found nice is that he covers all components of the investment strategy (what to buy, when to buy, how much to buy, when to enter, when to exit) and not just parts of it. The chapter on market trend identification was also very useful especially the discussion of bottoming out and how to get in again. I really liked the book.  

I ended up thinking CANSLIM may be a good method to run a part of my portfolio focused on hypergrowth companies. The methods requires a fair amount of work (especially in the early part as you are learning it, I guess). The MarketSmith tool was very good, I found myself using it a lot. I was not quite convinced by his arguments to enter after price consolidation only (on breakouts from patterns). I understand the rationale (avoid getting stopped out on natural volatility pullbacks) but you can achieve it by other means - like entering in partial amounts and building the position up by pyramiding up without sitting and watching your stock to up 100% and waiting for the eventual 20% pullback and recovery. But I do follow it, just to be consistent, at least until I get better at the method. 

Minervini's books were equally useful and worth the time to go through them. I especially liked the Stage 2 concept (don't enter overexteded stocks) and the concept of risk budget. Again, between his first and second book, he discusses the complete strategy and not just bit and pieces of it. Good books as well. 

I found some parts of the books omitting important information: for instance, the 100 model stock charts only show the part where the stock runs up and not the part where it crashes afterwards. Or the fact that the model charts mention the stock went up 400%+ but do not mention that using this method, you would capture two times 20% of it, at best. But I guess they have a product to sell so you need to use your own judgement to analyze the information. 

Once I was through the three books, I started trading the method (in May). I am at a point where I am looking for people familiar with the method to discuss. Anyone care to share experiences?",CANSLIM/Minervini methods - thoughts/experiences?,1628873875

I am currently using a BrokerageLink with my 403b and unfortunately, they don't allow the purchase of ETFs, only mutual funds. I'm trying to small-cap value tilt with FISVX (Russel 2000 value index, 0.05% ER), but there is an Avantis AVUVX (Also Russel 2000 but with profitability/other factors, 0.25%ER). The latter also charges a $50 transaction fee. Assuming I transfer 20,000 into the AVUVX fund, it would effectively be an additional 0.25% ER (50/20000 = 0.25%ER) for a total of 0.5%. Obviously, this ""effective"" ER increases with more transfers, and would only make sense for large one-time transfers.

I was just wondering if you guys thought the increased price would justify transferring over, perhaps 1x/yr when a large lump sum can be done to counteract the $50 fee. Thankfully these are all tax-protected and there are no $5M minimums through BrokerageLink.

""In Most Markets, Lower Risk Means Higher Reward"" by dawangy on LessWrong 

&gt;In my view, the most comprehensive empirical study of a similar result was in Frazzini and Pedersen. In this paper the authors examined the low beta phenomenon by constructing hypothetical portfolios that are long low beta stocks and short high beta stocks in market-neutral ratios. Using this approach, the authors determined that low beta was associated with excess returns in 19 out of 20 countries' stocks, and was also true in many alternative markets such as those for corporate bonds, treasuries, foreign exchange, and commodities. The in-sample effect was strongest in the Canadian stock market, and the Austrian stock market was the only studied market for which the effect was (very slightly) negative. The out of sample construction based on the methodology created in sample was also positive in all nations studied except Sweden. Note that this is slightly different from my headline, as it suggests that the ""risk-adjusted"" returns of low beta stocks is higher than those of high beta stocks. Not necessarily that the returns of low beta stocks are higher in general.

&gt;The hypothesis of Frazzini and Pedersen is that some investors are leverage constrained, meaning that they are less capable of borrowing funds in order to increase exposure to equity. This leads those less capable of leverage to seek the higher expected returns dictated by their preferences through exposure to riskier stocks, which reduces the risk adjusted expected returns of riskier stocks because investors will purchase them at discounted expected returns to achieve artificial market leverage.","""In Most Markets, Lower Risk Means Higher Reward"" ""In Most Markets, Lower Risk Means Higher Reward"" by dawangy on LessWrong",1628891507
